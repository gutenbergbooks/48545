<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> seven fables flanked by the covers
of this book have to do with as
many strange and wonderful happenings
in the history of an infantry
regiment&mdash;an infantry regiment of volunteers&mdash;in
time of peace. They are seasoned
abundantly, from end to end, with that
which is stranger than fiction, but they
differ slightly from “muster-rolls for pay,”
which, I am informed, one has to submit
under oath.</p>

<p>If you are of the volunteer service, you
may be trusted, I think, to catch the spirit
of these stories; if you are of The Army,
you may consider the tales as illustrative
of the customs of a service to which your
own is but distantly related; but if it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
your great misfortune to be an out-and-out
civilian&mdash;why, then you must take your
chance with what follows, and lay no
blame upon me should you find yourself
on unfamiliar ground.</p>

<p>In another and an earlier book I related
how we of The Third came to settle ourselves
in our off-duty quarters up in The
Battery; how Sam, the veteran gunner of
a by-gone war, won his medal, our most
profound respect, and a place among us
second in importance only to that of the
colonel commanding; how our horse,
“Acme,” gained for us great renown and
no little wealth; how Larry, our seventh
major, rose to the rank of hero; and many
other odd truths concerning the Old Regiment.
So it may be that, by reason of
having read these things, you are no
stranger to us, to our traditions, and to our
easy-going ways. But even if to-day you
come for the first time into our midst, you
are none the less welcome&mdash;and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
find awaiting you a chair, a pipe, and a
pewter mug at our long oaken table, to say
nothing of an open-hearted greeting from
as good a set of fellows as ever lent their
names to the adornment of a regimental
roster.</p>

<h2 class="vspace">THE MARCH<br />
<span class="small">OF THE</span><br />
<span class="gesperrt">FORTY THIEVES.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> long, low room that we call The
Battery seemed most depressingly
quiet. Sam was there, to be sure, but
his presence hardly counted, for he was
sound-and-fast asleep in his own little box,
partitioned off in the far corner.</p>

<p>I foraged ’round for pipe and plug-cut,
lighted up, and wandered over to the bookcase.
There was nothing in it&mdash;nothing that
I felt up to the bother of reading. I went
over to the long oaken table and picked up a
copy of the <i>Service Journal</i>, but it proved to
be a back number, so I tossed it down again
upon the disorderly pile of periodicals, and
then climbed upon the cushions of the wide
dormer-window, just as the rattle of wheels
upon the stone flagging in the court far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
below shattered the stillness of the July
afternoon.</p>

<p>A few words in a familiar voice came indistinctly
up to me; the wheels clattered
again, but more faintly, as the unseen vehicle
was driven out through the archway to the
street beyond; and steadily up the long
stairs, flight after flight, sounded a quick,
firm tread. And then the door swung wide
upon its hinges, and Bones, our surgeon&mdash;Dr.
Sawin, outside the service&mdash;broke into
the room, with his favorite greeting: “Hello,
inside! <i>Never mind the guard!</i>”</p>

<p>“The countersign is correct. Advance
friend,” said I, from number-one post on the
cushions. “Likewise, the guard, being asleep,
will not turn out. Come over here, and
make less riot.”</p>

<p>“Just been to see Ali Baba,” explained
Bones, dropping upon a chair near the window.
“He’ll be mended now in a week or
ten days. Thought I’d run up here to glance
through the papers. Sent my gig away because
it’s too hot to leave the horse standing.”</p>

<p>I slipped off my coat and tossed it to the
other end of the window-seat, preparatory to
elevating my feet for my greater comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Bones also reduced his apparel, and provided
himself with smoking materials. Then, with
his first few puffs, he said, reflectively, “It’s
funny how that ‘Ali Baba’ title has been
handed down from captain to captain in ‘L’
company. Why, it must be more than
twenty years since the day of the first
‘Ali.’”</p>

<p>A side glance at the surgeon confirmed the
impression I had received from the peculiar
intonation of his voice: his hands were clasped
behind his head, his long legs were draped
over the arm of his chair, his eyes were half
closed, and he was on the point of being
talkative.</p>

<p>Now I, as the latest comer upon the staff,
have to serve in the capacity of waste-basket,
and all the older officers feel at liberty to use
me at any time when they feel the need of
freeing themselves of some mildewed old yarn.
So I drew a long breath, gave a grunt by way
of signifying that I would suffer uncomplainingly,
and settled myself to stare vacantly
out through the open casement, under the
wide, striped awning, and across the broad
expanse of roofs towards the green hills, far
beyond the city’s limits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
“Yes, it must be all of twenty years,” said
the surgeon, seeing that I made no effort to
escape, “for it was before I’d been enticed
into the service&mdash;and I’ve been dealing out
ginger and pills to this regiment for more
years than I care to remember.</p>

<p>“Things were different in those days: the
establishment wasn’t on quite the footing that
it’s on now. In fact, the true military spirit
was at rather a low ebb, and discipline, to
put it mildly, was far from rigid. So the
service&mdash;even though there were good men
in it then&mdash;was rather in disrepute.</p>

<p>“At that time one Merrowbank was captain
of ‘L.’ He was a typical old-timer, a
<i>milishy</i>-man from the word go, and a glittering
example of all that a volunteer officer
shouldn’t be. It was a pet theory of his that
the commissioned officer should be able to
find stowage for just twice as much Santa
Cruz product as the enlisted man could manage
to put away&mdash;and he lived up to his
theory most consistently. Moreover, he had
a childlike faith that Providence would keep
a watchful eye upon his company property,
and he never allowed himself any worry
about trifles like shortages in equipment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Well, he’s been out for a long time now&mdash;and
it’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nihil nisi bonum</i>, you know&mdash;but he
had a gay old company, they say.</p>

<p>“When the brigade went into camp that
year&mdash;whatever year it was&mdash;Merrowbank
took down three officers and forty men, which
was a good showing, so far as strength went,
for those days. But he found himself short
on rifles and great-coats and any quantity of
other stuff, and his implicit faith in Providence
was much shaken by the discovery; so
much shaken that he felt it incumbent upon
him to rustle ’round a bit in his own behalf.</p>

<p>“So he got his non-com.’s into his tent the
first night of camp, explained the nature of
the emergency, and issued a G.O., to the
effect that before the next morning every
man in ‘L’ who was short of equipment must
manage to make up the deficiency&mdash;how, he
didn’t care a coppery cent, though he’d suggest
that it mightn’t be a bad idea to be
neighborly with the other regiments of the
brigade, just to see how well off <i>they</i> might
be in the matter of State property.</p>

<p>“Well, the non-com.’s faithfully promulgated
both Merrowbank’s general order and
the hint that went with it, and the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
went off on a visit to each of the twenty-four
tents in Line Officers’ Row, and finally stowed
himself away in bed with a comfortable sense
of having done his best to supplement the
watchful care of Providence.”</p>

<p>“And in the morning, I suppose, he woke
up to find his property complete, and the
company fully armed and equipped,” said I,
feeling that it was time for me to give some
assurance of having been listening.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was about the size of it, as the
story goes,” assented Bones, sending a big
puff of smoke on its way towards the open
window. “But poor Merrowbank had rather
a rude awakening on that particular morning,
for he was roused by a volley of sharp raps
upon his tent-pole, and a good bit before
reveille, too.</p>

<p>“As was only natural, he swore fluently,
though politely, at the people outside his
canvas, and desired to know what the hallelujah
they meant by stirring him up at that
hour. But on recognizing the colonel’s voice&mdash;Hazeltine
was colonel then&mdash;he tumbled
himself out of bed in two-four time; and
when he had poked his head through the
tent-flaps and had discovered not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
colonel but also old General Starbuckle standing
outside in the dim, gray light, he found
his ideas coming very rapidly to him, and
apologized most profusely for the warmth of
his first greeting.</p>

<p>“‘That’s all right, Captain,’ said the colonel,
with ominous calmness, glancing keenly
at the blinking eyes and rumpled hair framed
by the opening in the tent curtain. ‘It’s
very annoying, of course, to be roused at
such an unseemly hour, after a hard day&mdash;<i>and
night!</i> But General Starbuckle wishes
to see for himself how quickly you can turn
out your company, in heavy-marching order,
as if in response to a sudden call for special
duty. I shall take time from the present
moment.’ And he sprung open the lid of
his watch, holding it up to his face to note
the exact hour.</p>

<p>“Merrowbank desperately plunged into his
uniform, stirred up his lieutenants, routed
out his first sergeant, and then joined his
superior officers; the sleepy men turned out,
grumbling and growling, and commenting
profanely upon the proceedings; and finally
‘L’ stood formed-up in its company street.</p>

<p>“‘Very fair work, Captain,’ observed Hazeltine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
closing his watch with a snap, but
omitting any mention of the time taken by
the formation; ‘very fair indeed. Now, General,
at your <span class="locked">convenience’&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘What’s your strength, sir?’ asked old
Starbuckle, glancing along the line of ill-tempered
men.</p>

<p>“‘Three-forty, sir,’ said Merrowbank, suppressing
a yawn, and wishing that the old
man would be done with his precious nonsense.</p>

<p>“‘Arms and equipments complete and in
proper condition?’ questioned the general,
sinking his chin deeply into the upturned
collar of his great-coat, and sharply eyeing
his unsuspecting victim.</p>

<p>“‘They should be, sir,’ replied the captain,
catching the point of his sword in his left hand,
and bending the blade into a semicircle
of shining steel.</p>

<p>“‘H’m! Yes, they <i>should</i> be,’ grunted old
Starbuckle, with a tug at his white imperial,
‘but I think I’ll inspect. You, sir, will remain
at your post. Will you accompany me,
Colonel?’</p>

<p>“The two senior officers slowly passed
down the opened ranks, making a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
minute inspection of every man. The colonel
had lugged out a note-book, and from time to
time, at some muttered remark from the general,
he would make a brief entry, grinning
wickedly at each fresh line of pencilling&mdash;for
he was no friend of Merrowbank’s, and
he found great joy in the task in which he
was engaged.</p>

<p>“At length&mdash;just as the drowsy drummers
of the regiment were turning out to beat reveille&mdash;the
inspection came to an end, and the
general, coming to the front of the company,
said, ‘Captain, you will direct your first
lieutenant to report the result of reveille
roll-call. I wish a word with you in your
quarters.’</p>

<p>“Entering the captain’s tent, old Starbuckle
planted himself solidly upon a camp-stool,
frowned, and said, ‘You are aware,
Colonel Hazeltine, how strongly I object to
having companies of line organizations bear
any designation other than that of regimental
number and company letter: has this company
any name of an unofficial nature?’</p>

<p>“‘It used to be called the Norfolk Fencibles,
I believe,’ replied Hazeltine, wondering
at what the brigade commander could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
driving, ‘and that name is sometimes used
even now&mdash;on social occasions.’</p>

<p>“‘Norfolk Fencibles, eh? Tasteful title,
that&mdash;<i>very</i>!’ grunted the gray-bearded old
soldier. ‘And you report forty men, Captain?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir: officers, three&mdash;and forty men,’
said poor Merrowbank, feeling a caravan of
cold shivers go travelling down his spine, for
from the general’s tone he felt abundantly certain
that something nasty was coming next.</p>

<p>“‘Well, from now on,’ fairly snorted old
Starbuckle, ‘this company will be known as
<i>The Forty Thieves</i>!&mdash;and with my sanction
freely given. Kindly read what you have
there, Colonel.’</p>

<p>“The colonel pawed over the leaves of his
note-book. ‘One rifle, marked “M, 4th;”’
he began; two ditto, marked “C, 4th;” one
ditto, marked “B, 7th;” one great-coat, with
red <span class="locked">facings’&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘An infantryman stupid enough to rob
the gunners ought to be discharged for color-blindness,
if for nothing else,’ interrupted
the general, in the deepest disgust.</p>

<p>“‘One ditto, with <i>yellow</i> facings; two ditto,
<span class="locked">marked’&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
“‘There, that’ll do!’ broke in Starbuckle.
‘There are two more pages full of iniquity;
but I haven’t the patience to listen to ’em.
Not a word, sir!’ as poor Merrowbank desperately
began an incoherent explanation;
‘<i>not a word</i>! It’s a bad enough business as
it stands&mdash;don’t try to make it worse.
I’ll explain for your enlightenment that I
took a quiet stroll around the camp last
night, to observe for myself how the men
were conducting themselves, and it so happened
that I was just outside your tent when
you were giving your non-commissioned
officers instructions in petit larceny&mdash;and
canvas walls are thin, <i>very</i> thin!</p>

<p>“‘To put it into plain English, I was eavesdropping&mdash;though
unintentionally&mdash;and
I must apologize, of course, for the way in
which I caught you off your guard. But I
wish to state right here, Captain, that I can’t
approve of your methods, however much I
may feel compelled to admire their results;
and you therefore will be allowed to send in
your papers immediately upon your return
from this camp. I let you down easily, sir,
for the sake of this regiment, which is a good
one, and as a mark of my consideration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
your colonel, who is trying to bring the service
into efficiency and good repute.’ And
with this the general rose stiffly, and marched
out of the tent, without bothering to bid
Merrowbank a good morning.</p>

<p>“And that was how The Forty Thieves
came into their title. The story leaked
out, as such stories will, and for the rest
of that camp Merrowbank was known as
Ali Baba. When his papers had gone in
and he had gone <i>out</i>, the nickname was
handed down to the next captain of ‘L’&mdash;and
it will be many a long day, I fancy,
before the line of Ali becomes extinct in the
regiment.”</p>

<p>“But Ali Baba wasn’t <i>captain</i> of the
thieves&mdash;at least, as <i>I</i> remember the original
fable,” I objected.</p>

<p>“What’s that to do with it?” demanded
Bones, getting up from his chair. “Haven’t
you been with us long enough to know that
we of The Third are never tied down by precedent?”</p>

<p>“But all this happened long before you
were in the service,” I ventured. “How does
it happen that you can reel it off as smoothly
as if you’d been there to see and hear it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
“Oh, I’ve heard the colonel tell it so
often that I’ve got the whole lesson by
heart,” admitted Bones.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said wearily, “<i>and so have I</i>!”</p>

<p>The surgeon came over to the window and
for a moment stood looking down into the
deserted court. The sun had sunk lower,
and now its rays came slantwise under the
awning and through the opened sashes, to
flash in dazzling brightness upon the polished
blades and glittering spear-heads of the barbaric
weapons clustered on the wall above
the bookcase. A fly buzzed its way across
the broad track of light, and Bones made a
sweep at it with his big hand, but the wary
little insect promptly changed direction by
the right flank, gave the slip to his burly
enemy, and joined a squad of his kindred
deployed in open order upon the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Quiet, isn’t it?” said the medicine-man;
“quiet as an empty fizz-bottle. Never knew
the old shop to be so empty at this late hour
of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It’s July,” I suggested, “and half the
fellows are out of town.”</p>

<p>Bones turned and glanced down the long
room towards Sam’s corner, whence at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
came the low sound of a contented snore.
“Seems something like church, eh?” he said.
“We haven’t the sermon, but the proper
accompaniment is all here. I take it that the
veteran has yielded to heat prostration.
Well, I’ll not bother him: I can be my own
commissary. Ginger-pop and ice wouldn’t
be deadly in the present state of the atmosphere.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’ll follow your lead,” said I, rapping out
the ashes from my pipe; “ginger-pop’ll do
for the foundation&mdash;and I can trust you to
trim it up properly.”</p>

<p>Stepping softly, the surgeon made his way
into Sam’s province, presently returning in
triumph with two tall glasses of golden-brown
nectar, crested with finely crushed ice, and
faintly suggestive of old Monogram. I manœuvred
a small table into position between
two roomy arm-chairs, and then refilled and
lighted my pipe.</p>

<p>“Here’s fun!” said the doctor, politely
nodding in my direction, and causing a perceptible
ebb in the icy tide in his glass. I
made haste to secure the remaining tumbler
before replying, in deference to Bones’ profession,
“Here’s hoping for an epidemic!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
“Now, speaking of The Forty Thieves,”
said the doctor, setting his glass back upon
the table, and thereby adding another ring of
moisture to the two already in evidence upon
the polished wood, “I suppose the proudest
day in their history was when&mdash;just hand
over that pipe, will you? It seems to be
drawing like a regular flue; mine’s stopped.”</p>

<p>I groaned, but handed over my pipe and
rose to hunt for another one. “Now you
can chatter along like an accommodation
train,” I said, after I had got myself finally
settled, with a fresh corn-cob in one hand
and my glass within easy reach of the other.</p>

<p>“Meaning with plenty of smoke, and frequent
stops for refreshments? Precisely,”
said Bones. “Well, it was a great day&mdash;the
day when The Forty Thieves did up All-Italy.
And nobody told me about that,
either: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">omnia ququæ vidi, quorum magna pars
fui</i>&mdash;Latin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m awake to the fact,” said I. “You
needn’t construe.”</p>

<p>“It was all of eight years back,” Bones
ran on, “for it was the year before Hazeltine
went up to the command of the brigade.
Colonel Elliott was major then, and Curtis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
who’s senior major now, at that time was
captain of ‘L’ and reigning Ali of The Forty
Thieves. And I?&mdash;well, I hadn’t been
commissioned, but was serving out the fag-end
of my third enlistment as hospital steward.
Gad! how the roster’s changed since.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tempora mutantur</i>&mdash;Latin!” I hastened
to put in at this favorable point. “Proceed,
you moss-grown veteran.”</p>

<p>“Well, this was the way of it,” said the
learned doctor, acknowledging by a grin
that honors were a stand-off on the score
of dead languages. “When it came ’round
to the time for our fall field-work that year,
Hazeltine packed us aboard the cars for
Glastonbury, down on the line of the B.S.
&amp; N.Y.</p>

<p>“For a wonder, the plan of operations was
not at all complicated. The main object of
the day’s work was to practise the men in
skirmishing and in the gaining of ground by
short platoon-rushes. So when we reached
our destination, we marched out from the
village a couple of miles, and then Elliott’s
battalion was detached and posted along a
stone wall and among some farm buildings,
facing a broad sweep of open meadow, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the rest of the regiment footed it along for
a mile farther, to return later in the character
of bloody invaders.</p>

<p>“Now, up to this point everything was
simple enough. But Elliott was&mdash;and, as
you may have noticed, still is&mdash;a strategist
of large calibre, and he’d taken the liberty of
making a slight addition to the cut-and-dried
plan of campaign. About a week before, he
had run down to Glastonbury to look over
the ground alone, and in the course of his
travels he’d made some observations in regard
to the lay of the land that set him to
thinking. And this is what he thought:</p>

<p>“His four companies were to be attacked
in front by the remaining eight, and in the
nature of things he was fairly certain of
being defeated, but he’d noted the fact that
on the left of his position there was a thick
growth of young timber, with an old wood-road
running off into it, and on following
this up he found that it made a circuit and
came out into the meadow in his front, in
such a way that a force marching over it
would find itself eventually in rear of the
right flank of the attacking party; and therefore
he reasoned that he could make things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
very entertaining for the colonel’s contingent
by availing himself of this feature of
the landscape, and mentally made his dispositions
accordingly.</p>

<p>“Now, <i>I</i> ought to have been with the
main body; but when Elliott’s battalion detached
itself I somehow got mixed up with
it, and when I found out my mistake I decided
to stay where I was&mdash;notwithstanding
the fact that the assistant surgeon had been
assigned to duty with the defence&mdash;rather
than go chasing over a dusty road after the
rest of the regiment. And that was where I
played in luck, for if I’d been at my proper
post I’d have missed my march with The
Forty Thieves, and all the sport that came in
at the end of it.</p>

<p>“Elliott had disposed his four companies
in line of battle along the stone wall, but as
soon as Colonel Hazeltine’s troops went out
of sight around a bend in the road he gave
some hurried instructions to Curtis, who
straightway started ‘L’ company off into the
woods. And then Elliott came riding down
the line, and caught sight of me.</p>

<p>“‘Hello!’ says he, ‘<i>you</i> here? We seem
to be pretty heavy laden with doctors. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
you hustle along after Curtis and his Thieves;
an independent column ought to have a
medicine-man of its own.’</p>

<p>“So I saluted, and went on a jog-trot after
‘L,’ with my field-case bumping and banging
against my hip, <span class="locked">and”&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“And mighty sour you were at the detail!”
I hazarded, getting up and going over
to the mantel after a supply of matches.</p>

<p>“And caught up with The Thieves just
after they’d got well into the bush,” said
Bones, without noticing my interruption.
“Well, I reported to Curtis, and got orders
to march either in the line of file-closers or
at the rear of the column; and choosing the
latter alternative, I trudged along quite contentedly,
a little N.C.S. all by myself. It
was a cloudy day, with just enough coolness
in the air to make marching pleasant, and I
thoroughly enjoyed the tramp along the
leafy, grass-grown path. The boys joked
and guyed each other&mdash;we were marching
route-step&mdash;and once they started in on a
song with a jolly, swinging refrain to it, but
Curtis shut ’em up in short order, for he
didn’t care to have his progress too widely
advertised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
“Now, Elliott had said that a march of
something like three-quarters of a mile would
bring us into the desired position for flanking
the colonel’s hostile forces, and he’d cautioned
Curtis not to cover his ground in less than
half an hour; so we strolled along slowly
and took things easily. But when, after
travelling for the best part of an hour, we
had seen no signs of a clearing, why, we
rather began to wonder where we were at,
and wherefore. You see, we were making
our way through the thickest of thick cover,
there wasn’t in the whole outfit such an
article as a compass, and there was no sun to
tell us which way our noses pointed.</p>

<p>“‘This begins to grow blamed ridiculous,’
said Curtis, after we’d patiently footed it for
about two miles and a half. ‘I’m not so dead
sure about our not being lost. But I’ve had
my orders. “Follow copy if it takes you out
of the window” is a good enough rule for
me’&mdash;in civil life, you know, Curtis was a
newspaper man&mdash;‘and so I’ll heel-and-toe it
over this blossoming path until we land in
the middle of next week.’</p>

<p>“‘Hello!’ he broke out a moment later,
‘the advance guard begins to show signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
life!’ And with that he halted the company,
as the sergeant&mdash;who, with two men, had
preceded the company by a hundred yards or
so&mdash;came running back towards us. ‘Well,
sergeant, what is it? Are we in sight of
land yet?’</p>

<p>“‘I haven’t <i>seen</i> anything, sir,’ reported
the sergeant, ‘but I just heard something like
shouting, and after that a few shots; not volleys,
just scattering pops.’</p>

<p>“‘The skirmishers starting in, most likely,’
commented Curtis, ‘though that wouldn’t account
for the shouting.’</p>

<p>“‘But the sound appeared to come from
our left,’ went on the sergeant; ‘and that
seems queer.’</p>

<p>“‘From your <i>left</i>?’ repeated Curtis, break-off
a small twig and thoughtfully chewing
one end of it. ‘The deuce it did! Then
we’ve marched half ’round a circle, or else
the colonel’s flanked <i>us</i>. According to all
the rules of the game the enemy ought to be
engaged on our right. <i>‘Tention!</i> Silence in
the ranks!’</p>

<p>“We all stood motionless in our tracks,
and listened intently. And sure enough,
from somewhere ahead of us and to our left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
there came the faint sound of a distant uproar,
and the echo of an occasional shot.</p>

<p>“‘H’m! I’m completely twisted,’ muttered
Curtis, as with wrinkled brows he stood listening
to the far-off racket. ‘I can’t seem to
make it out at all. Sounds like a picnic of
the Gentlemen’s Sons’ Chowder Club! Well,
push ahead with your men, sergeant, and keep
your eyes and ears well stretched. Keep
quiet, and close up, there in the company!’
And we took up our march again.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Halt!</i>’ commanded Curtis, in a low tone,
but sharply, as we turned an abrupt corner
in the path and caught sight of the sergeant
standing with one hand warningly uplifted.
‘Great Scott! We seem to be operating
against field-works, and heavy ones too!’
For across the old road, a couple of hundred
yards away down the leafy vista, there loomed
up before us a high, steep embankment of
bright, fresh gravel, clearly outlined against
the dull gray of the sky and the dark green
of the foliage.</p>

<p>“‘Now be perfectly silent, everybody; and
you, Lane’&mdash;to the first lieutenant&mdash;‘take
charge of the company. I’m going to look
into the situation for myself,’ said Curtis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
And then quickly running forward he joined
the sergeant and his men, scrambled with
them up the high bank, turned to the left,
and disappeared behind the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“For perhaps ten minutes we stood waiting
and listening. The noise now was distinctly
audible, and I counted the reports of
eleven shots before the captain’s figure again
came into view upon the crest of the gravel-bank.
Well, he waved his arm as a signal
for us to advance, and we double-timed it
down the path in beautiful form, for during
that halt of ours we had been growing terribly
inquisitive about what was in the wind, and
we were in somewhat of a hurry to find out.</p>

<p>“At a gesture from Curtis we halted at the
foot of the slope. He had pulled out a note-book,
and was scratching away in it like a
crazy reporter; but finally he ripped out two
or three leaves, folded them up, and sang out,
‘Corporal Campbell, you’re supposed to be a
sprinter: you will take this note, with my
compliments, to Major Elliott&mdash;and waste
no seconds in doing your distance. Give
your rifle and equipments to the hospital
steward. On your mark&mdash;set&mdash;<i>go</i>!’</p>

<p>“‘And now, boys,’ he continued, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
corporal, after loading me down with his impedimenta,
started off on his long run, ‘I’ve
found out what’s making all this row. In
the first place, it’s evident that we’ve been
travelling the wrong road’&mdash;it afterwards
appeared, though Elliott hadn’t notified us of
the fact, that there were <i>two</i> old wood-roads,
of which we carefully had avoided the right
one&mdash;‘and I haven’t the slightest idea of
where we are. But this embankment apparently
is the road-bed of that branch which
the B.&nbsp;S. &amp; N.&nbsp;Y. is building, and about a third
of a mile from us there’s a howling mob of
Italians&mdash;something less than a thousand and
more than two hundred of ’em: I didn’t stop
to count&mdash;laying regular siege to a shanty
in which, in all probability, they’ve got their
contractors cornered like rats in a trap. I
don’t know anything about the cause of the
shindy&mdash;more than likely it’s the old story
of overdue pay and ugly tempers&mdash;but it’s a
royal rumpus, whatever started it, and if nobody’s
been hurt yet, somebody’s bound to be
hurt soon, unless the strong arm of the law
sits down hard upon the troubled sea over
yonder.’ And with this elegant example of
metaphor he stopped to catch breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
“‘Now, after a fashion, <i>we</i> are the strong
arm of the law,’ went on Curtis, ‘and I think
it’s plainly our duty to sail in, and pour the
oil of peace upon the raging waters. I’ve no
orders to cover the case; I haven’t any “lawful
precept” from mayor or selectmen or anybody
else, but&mdash;<i>now don’t yell!</i>&mdash;if you’ll
follow me, I’ll take you along to see the entertainment.
All who’ll volunteer to go will
come to right-shoulder!’</p>

<p>“Up went the fifty-odd rifles in one-time-and-three-motions,
and Curtis continued:
‘That’s the proper stuff! Now, we shall be
a half-hundred against a very good-sized mob,
and though we are well enough armed, we’re
without any ammunition except blanks. It’s
dollars to dimes that the bare sight of us will
quiet down the ruction, but I don’t care to
take any chances. I’ve got to fit you out in
<i>some</i> way&mdash;how the pretty-pink-blazes shall
I do it?’</p>

<p>“He stood thinking for a moment, then
made the company form fours&mdash;we’d been
marching column-of-twos, the path being so
narrow&mdash;swung the fours into line, and
caused arms to be stacked. ‘Now every man
of you,’ said he, when the men stood clear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the stacks, ‘will provide himself with ten bits
of twig, of the same diameter as a lead-pencil,
and about half the length of one. See that
the twigs are smooth and straight, so that
they’ll slip cleanly into the rifle-chamber&mdash;and,
if you want to, you may sharpen one
end of ’em. <i>Break ranks!</i>&mdash;and start in on
your whittling.’</p>

<p>“‘Aren’t you afraid that those bullets will
be liable to key-hole, Captain?’ sang out one
of the lieutenants, with a pleasant grin at
his own humor and the prospect of coming
trouble.</p>

<p>“‘Can’t tell,’ replied Curtis cheerfully, ‘at
least, until we’ve tried ’em. I’m all at sea
about trajectories, initial velocities, and all
that. We’ll have to work out our musketry
theories as we go along. All fitted out, you
lads down there? Then fall in!’</p>

<p>“The company formed up, and broke
stacks; and then Curtis gave his final directions.
‘Just a word more, boys: if I have
to give the command “<i>load!</i>” you will open
chamber, thrust into the bore a wooden bullet,
and send home after it a blank cartridge.
You must keep muzzles elevated, or else your
projectiles will slip out. And lastly, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
wild men whom we’re going to visit should
exhibit any desire to rush us, I shall order
you to drop your cleaning-rods into your barrels&mdash;and
we’ll try the effect of harpooning
’em at short range. That’s all. Fours right&mdash;<i>march!</i>’
And like a small army of ants
we swarmed up the sloping bank of sliding
gravel, and started on our march down the
railway.</p>

<p>“Picking up the advance guard as we
went, we tramped rapidly forward, and in a
very short time came in sight of the theatre
of operations. Sure enough, the comedy&mdash;or,
for all we then knew, the tragedy&mdash;was
in full blast, for a roaring mob of swarthy
Italians was surging ’round a roughly built
shanty, and amusing itself by yelling, and
sending an occasional stone or bullet at
the closed doors and windows. Whoever
was inside was lying very low indeed, for
there was no response from within to the
demonstrations of the attacking party, and
only the lively interest shown by those outside
made it appear that the place was tenanted
at all.</p>

<p>“The rascals caught sight of us when we
were about forty rods from them, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
moment I thought that I detected signs of
a stampede; but when they saw how few
we were&mdash;for fifty men in column-of-fours
don’t make a very imposing showing&mdash;they
bundled together in a devilishly ugly and
suggestive sort of way, and waited for us to
come up.</p>

<p>“We left the railway, formed line upon a
level stretch of ground, moved forward a hundred
yards or so, and then halted.</p>

<p>“‘Now may heaven forgive me the sinful
thought,’ said Curtis, as he stood sizing up
the savage rabble before him, ‘but I’ve seven-eighths
of a mind to give it to ’em where they
stand! That aggregation of deviltry is too
tempting!’ But, however strong the temptation
may have been, he manfully overcame
it, and stepping half-a-dozen paces to the front
called out, ‘Is there any one among you who
speaks English?’</p>

<p>“For answer the children of sunny Italy
sent up a derisive and most provoking yell;
and so Curtis, failing to obtain an interpreter
from the ranks of the enemy, turned to us,
with, ‘Not much satisfaction to be had from
them, apparently. Does anybody in the company
know their lingo?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
“It seemed that our ignorance was on a
par with theirs, for nobody confessed to a
working knowledge of Italian. For one
insane moment, to be sure, I was impelled to
step out and address the offending foreigners
in the ancient tongue of their native land;
but to save my soul I couldn’t lay hand upon
anything besides <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arma virumque cano</i>, <span class="locked">and”&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Latin again, by thunder!” I said, enthusiastically.
“Ah! but you <i>are</i> up in the
humanities, Bones.”</p>

<p>“And that, you know,” placidly went on
the surgeon, with a nod in recognition of my
admiration, “was hardly the extent of what
I wished to say&mdash;though it may have been,
after a fashion, apposite to the requirements
of the occasion. So I let the chance to distinguish
myself slip by unimproved, and
stuck to my place in the file-closers.</p>

<p>“‘Now I <i>am</i> in a hole!’ admitted Curtis,
after this double failure in his attempt at
opening the way to a parley. ‘I’m stumped
at this phase of the business&mdash;and blessed if
I know just what card to lead next!’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! you <i>will</i>, will you?’ he growled, as
three or four stones came sailing over at us.
‘Well, that’s cue enough for me. <i>Fix bayonets!</i>’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
There was a metallic rattle and clash,
as the fifty steel jabbing-tools were put into
place for business. ‘With ball cartridge&mdash;<i>load!</i>’</p>

<p>“‘And now, in the name of the Commonwealth,’
bellowed Curtis, after he had seen
his men tuck away in their rifles wood enough
to keep a match factory running full time for
a week, ‘I command ye to disperse!’</p>

<p>“‘Skip&mdash;scatter&mdash;<i>vamose!</i>’ he added by
way of explanation, waving his arms like a
farmer driving away mosquitoes. ‘Get a
move on you, and clear out, you obstinate
lunatics! <i>Sabe? Comprenez? Understand?</i>’</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that the mob displayed
symptoms of wavering: and when Curtis, in
his deepest and most awe-inspiring tone, commanded,
‘<i>Aim!</i>’ I drew a breath of relief, for
I felt that when The Forty Thieves levelled
their fifty rifles in one long, threatening line,
a break must surely follow. But just at this
critical moment the door of the shanty was
flung open, and three men dashed out and
went tearing off towards the woods. And
<i>then</i> the break came!&mdash;though not just in
the way I had anticipated. For, utterly disregarding
us, the swarthy madmen, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
wild yell of delight, sprang off in pursuit of
their escaping prey.</p>

<p>“It was a horrible sight&mdash;upon my soul,
a <i>horrible</i> sight!&mdash;to see the brutal fierceness
of that sudden rush. And it made me fairly
sick to think of the pounding and stabbing
and murderous kicking that surely would
follow if the mob once caught the miserable
men whom it was hunting down. I only
wish that those who frown upon the service
could have been with us then&mdash;for they
would have had an awful object-lesson in the
necessity for maintaining the military establishment,
even in this enlightened land and
in these peaceful days.</p>

<p>“I must admit that the unexpected hideousness
of the whole thing threw me clean
off my balance for the moment; but Curtis
kept his head, and did his duty as he saw it
cut out for him. ‘Aim waist-high!’ he commanded,
running to the windward flank of
the company in order to observe the effect
of the volley. ‘<i>Fire!</i>’ And, with a report
like that of a single big cannon-cracker, The
Forty Thieves came into the game.</p>

<p>“I heard a chorus of outlandish yelps and
howls immediately after the volley rang out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and, to my infinite relief and satisfaction,
when the smoke drifted up and away I saw
that the rabble was scattering in every direction.
Five or six men were down, but
whether they’d been hit or simply had tumbled
over each other, I can’t say, for&mdash;with
the exception of one fellow&mdash;they all
scrambled straightway to their feet, and
pranced off to cover in a way that convinced
me that their wounds, if they had any,
weren’t liable to be instantly fatal.</p>

<p>“Well, there was <i>my</i> cue. I handed to
the nearest sergeant the rifle I’d been carrying,
and ran over to hold a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">post mortem</i>&mdash;still
more Latin, you’ll observe&mdash;on the man
that we’d bowled over. When I started
towards him he seemed to be out of it, for he
lay quite still; but just as I reached him
he began to jabber and snarl and twist
himself into bow-knots, for all the world as
if he’d eaten a peck of green apples, and was
undergoing the consequences. Flapping him
over upon his back I began to search for his
hurt, but I didn’t have to make a very extended
hunt, for&mdash;well, what do you suppose
I found?”</p>

<p>“Can’t guess,” said I, fishing out a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
ice from the bottom of my emptied glass;
“unless your man was skewered on one of
those wooden plugs.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so wide as it might be,”
laughed Bones, “for I found a stylographic
pen&mdash;yes, sir; a <i>stylographic pen</i>!&mdash;tightly
driven into the muscles of his neck. Regular
hypodermic injection of ink, by ginger! <i>That</i>
proved the pen mightier than the sword,
eh?”</p>

<p>“So it would seem,” said I. “But whose
pen was it?”</p>

<p>“I never found out,” said the surgeon.
“Whoever it was that got excited enough to
shoot it away was too much ashamed to claim
it afterwards, and I still have it.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s nearly all the story of the
war with Italy. We held the field until
Elliott came up with his battalion; and later,
Hazeltine came ploughing down the railway
with the other eight companies&mdash;after which,
of course, peace reigned supreme. I daresay
you remember the court of inquiry on Curtis,
and the newspaper discussion about the
whole business?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, rising from my chair, after
a glance at my watch; “and I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
reading that Curtis came near getting into
uncomfortably hot water for taking the law
so calmly into his hands.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That was all very well,” said
the doctor, rising and going towards the spot
where he had tossed his coat. “But if those
who questioned Curtis’ authority to do as he
did only could have seen what <i>I</i> had the
privilege of seeing, they’d have chipped in to
buy him a presentation sword, instead of
criticising his actions so freely. Well, I
must dine somewhere, I suppose, and I think
your club will do me.” And we slipped
quietly down the stairs, leaving Sam still
sleeping.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>A TALE OF TWO TOWERS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">This</span> tale might just as well have been
christened <i>Under Two Flags</i>, for it
was under two flags, and through the
medium of a third one, that all the trouble
worked itself out. But, since another and
an earlier writer has had the bad taste to
apply this desirable title to a creation frankly
lacking in the first elements of that which is
the truth, I am constrained, because of its
unfortunate associations, to put it to one side
and seek yet another&mdash;for I find myself restricted
to the setting-down of none but sombre
facts. And the facts in the matter are
these:</p>

<p>One afternoon in late September it chanced
that my personal affairs took me up into the
twelfth story of one of the lofty office-buildings
which rear themselves, crag-like, above
the very fertile soil of those shadowy and narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
valleys, our down-town streets. What
was my exact errand is here of no consequence.
It is enough if I say that I was endeavoring
to make a man see a certain thing
in the same light in which <i>I</i> saw it, and that,
after having failed most miserably in the attempt,
I had risen to go, when he glanced
out through the window and said, “You’re
up in that sort of thing: tell me, what’s
going on over yonder?”</p>

<p>I followed the direction of his glance,
across a mile-wide wilderness of ill-assorted
roofs and chimneys, to where the great tower
of the regimental armory lifts its bulk above
the brick-and-mortar dwarfs that cluster in its
shadow. And there, upon the summit of the
topmost flanking-turret, my eye caught the
flutter of a speck of red bunting.</p>

<p>“That?” said I; “why, that’s a signal
detachment at flag-practice. Well, I must
be going. Sorry I can’t make you listen
to reason.” And I went&mdash;to risk my life
in the downward rush of an express elevator.</p>

<p>Now, that glance from the twelfth-story
window sealed my fate for the rest of the
afternoon. My good nature had been placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
under heavy strain, and the never-ending
rush and racket of the swarming streets
jarred so tormentingly upon my tired head
that&mdash;with the blessed recklessness of the
boy who cares not one darn whether school
keeps or not&mdash;I consigned business to total
smash, swung myself upon a passing car, and
was trundled gaily along towards freedom,
sunlight, and the armory.</p>

<p>“For Kenryck will be there,” I told myself,
“and I can talk to him. And my pipe
will be there, and I can smoke it. And I
can sit on the parapet wall, and look out over
the harbor&mdash;and forget how infernally mean
everything is.”</p>

<p>And Kenryck was there. I dropped off
the car, walked down to the armory, dived
into the staff-room to get my pipe from its
pigeon-hole in my desk, dived into the armorer’s
den after a bunch of matches, and
then climbed up and up, flight after flight of
narrow stairs, to the top of the main tower.
And there, in luxurious ease, Kenryck sat in
state upon a camp-stool: a note-book on his
knee, a bull-dog jammed between his teeth,
and his field-glasses well in play.</p>

<p>“Kenryck, I’m weary,” I announced, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
my head emerged from the trap in the tower
roof, “and I’ve come to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, will you, for a minute,” said
Kenryck cordially. “Hi! you, up there”&mdash;to
the signalman twenty feet in the air above
us, upon the little turret&mdash;“what’s that?
How’s that last message? <i>No enemy visible
on Lexington road?</i> Yes, that’s right. Down
flag! Rest!” Then to me, “Hullo, old
man. Pull the rest of yourself out of that
hole, and come on deck. Royal old afternoon,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>I stepped up and out upon the tiles.
“Don’t mind me in the least, Ken.,” I said.
“I’ve not come to bother you. I’m only
here for rest and peaceful contemplation. So
go ahead with your wig-wagging, and I’ll be
a non-combatant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re no bother at all,” said Kenryck
very kindly. “It’s the inquisitive maniacs
who ask fool questions and think it’s
queer that I don’t offer to teach ’em the
whole code in five minutes&mdash;<i>they’re</i> the ones
that make signalling an everlasting joy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said I, taking off my hat,
to let the fresh breeze rumple its way through
my hair. “But I’ve stopped your game, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the same. Wake up those flags of yours: I
like to watch them waving.”</p>

<p>“You’ve stopped nothing,” protested Kenryck.
“I’d been squinting through these
glasses until my eyes ached, and I was just
going to take a minute off, when you came
popping up through the trap like the fairy in
a pantomime.”</p>

<p>“I’m breaking in three new men,” he went
on, in a lower tone. “One of ’em”&mdash;with a
nod towards the turret&mdash;“I’ve got in the
box up there: one of my sergeants has another,
out on Corey Hill: and the third one’s
in charge of still another sergeant, over across
the river, in Cambridge, on the tower of Memorial
Hall. Running a three-station circuit,
you see. Message starts here, goes through
the hill station, and lands on top of t’other
tower: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i> with the answer. I’m taking
it easy, you’ll notice: just sitting here in
the shade and keeping tabs on the Cambridge
station through that embrasure. My man
overhead calls off the signals from the hill: I
jot ’em down: and so I can see that they
tally with the original. Great system!”</p>

<p>“Great head!” said I: then, with an upward
glance at the clean-cut face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
young soldier leaning easily against the parapet
of the turret, “You’ve pulled in some
good men, eh?”</p>

<p>“Beauties, all three of ’em!” said Kenryck
enthusiastically; “just out of college; all
from the same class. Only had ’em a trifle
over three months, but they’ve picked up the
trick to a charm. Clever? Well, rather!
Just see how easily this boy handles his business.”
And calling out&mdash;“Attention! Call
‘B’ station”&mdash;my friend the signal officer
went on with his work.</p>

<p>For a time, as he told off the combinations
to be made, I followed the fluttering of the
swiftly dipping and rising flag. But the
whole thing was Sanscrit to me, and it wasn’t
long before I wearied of watching it. So
when Kenryck, in an interval between messages,
turned to me and said, “Simple
enough, isn’t it? Begin to catch on?”&mdash;I
answered, “Well, perhaps in about twenty
years I might, but just at present the waving
of a red flag conveys to me only four meanings&mdash;‘Auction,’
when it’s waved before a
building; ‘Miss,’ when it’s waved across the
face of a target; ‘Stop!’ when it’s waved in
front of a railway train; and ‘Come ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
fast!’ when it’s waved in the face of an ugly
bull.” And having thus frankly admitted
myself a rank outsider, so far as concerned
the science of signalling, I gave myself over
to the soothing influence of tobacco and the
contemplation of my surroundings.</p>

<p>It has been my fortune to find many a less
attractive spot than the tiled roof of our armory
tower, with its encircling parapet, broken
by alternate embrasure and loop-holed merlon,
and with its octagonal turret at one corner,
standing&mdash;like a sentry on post&mdash;in
bold relief against the sky. Moreover, the
sun was warm, the breeze was cool, and the
combination was altogether comforting. And
I speedily forgot, one after another, the petty
annoyances of my down-town day.</p>

<p>I stepped over to the breast-high wall,
rested my elbows upon the capstone, dropped
my chin into my hands, and gazed out over
the world. Far down in the streets below I
could see the pigmy shapes of men, busily
crawling to and fro in the anxious chase after
money, and seeming&mdash;they and their affairs,
too&mdash;so pitifully insignificant. Which
caused me to reflect that it would be good
that all mankind should spend an hour each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
day upon a tower, to gain a better idea of the
relative size of things. And I farther was
impressed. But never mind. This is a tale
of <i>two</i> towers, and I am allowing myself to
neglect the other of the twain.</p>

<p>“Mother of Moses!” muttered Kenryck,
just as I had turned&mdash;after a sweeping
glance around the range of low, green hills
which, upon three sides, hem in the city&mdash;to
look out upon the harbor, with its gray-walled
forts and glistening sails, “<i>Mother</i> of
Moses! What ails the boys in Cambridge?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell, I’m sure,” said I, looking
across the river towards the spot where the
other tower showed itself above the trees.
“I fail to see signs of anything distressful.
Time <i>was</i> when I knew what ailed the boys
in Cambridge&mdash;but that time’s long gone
by! What seems to be the excitement at
the present moment?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to know,” said Kenryck,
as the young fellow upon the turret
began to call off the signals from the second
station. “They’ve just sent this message&mdash;it’s
being flagged over from the hill now&mdash;‘<i>Big
trouble here! Want advice. Shall we
explain?</i>’ Now what does that mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
“Ask ’em,” said I promptly. “Wig-wag
the information that I’m here&mdash;ready to furnish
advice in car-load lots as soon as they’ve
sent on their explanation.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said my friend, with dry politeness.
“I’m more than fortunate in having
you with me.” Then, to the man with
the flag, “O.K. that last message, Millar, and
add, ‘<i>Explain.</i>’”</p>

<p>Up and down, sidewise and to the front,
went the flapping square of red bunting with
its core of snowy white; while Kenryck, in
readiness to catch the first responsive signal,
trained his glasses upon the ‘cross-river
station.</p>

<p>“Here it comes,” he said, as the distant
speck of color awoke to spasmodic and rapid
motion. “Now we shall be given understanding.
Hello! the sergeant must be doing
the flagging: Orcutt couldn’t send the
words along at that rate of speed.”</p>

<p>“Translate for my benefit, Ken., will
you?” said I, coming over to his side. “I’m
consumed by curiosity. I’ll swear solemnly
not to let any information fall into the hands
of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Pick up my note-book,” he answered hurriedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
without changing his position or allowing
his eyes to wander for an instant from
the opposite tower, “and scratch down what
I give you. Ready? Well, then, start off
with this: ‘Man&mdash;making&mdash;fuss&mdash;at&mdash;base&mdash;of&mdash;tower.’
Got that? ‘Says&mdash;Orcutt&mdash;owes&mdash;him&mdash;big&mdash;money.’”</p>

<p>“Yes I’ve got it: all of it,” said I, snapping
a rubber band across the page as a check
upon its tendency to get away from me in the
fresh breeze. “Very interesting, so far. Go
on, old man: give us another chapter of it.
I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>“Ease away on your chatter, can’t you?”
said Kenryck, a trifle earnestly. “You’ll get
me all balled-up in my receiving. Here,
take this: ‘Man’s&mdash;confounded&mdash;insolent:
standing&mdash;in&mdash;street: shouting&mdash;all&mdash;sorts&mdash;of&mdash;abuse&mdash;up&mdash;at&mdash;Orcutt.’
There, the sergeant’s stopped sending, to give
us a chance to digest what we already
have.”</p>

<p>Word by word the message, unaltered by
its transmission through the hands of the
party at the second station, was passed
down to us by the turret signalman. Something
in his tone drew my attention, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
looked up at him. He was red in the face
with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>“Is your man Orcutt efficient with his
hands?” I asked Kenryck.</p>

<p>“Ought to be,” he replied. “He played
left guard on the eleven for a couple of
years.”</p>

<p>“You’d better ask him, then,” I suggested,
feeling that a rare opportunity for testing the
fighting capacity of the volunteer service had
arrived, “why he doesn’t fly down from his
roost and punch the fellow’s head?”</p>

<p>“I will!” said Kenryck promptly. And
off went the question on its trip around the
circuit.</p>

<p>The reply came quickly back: “Citizen’s
name is Boardman. Has policeman with
him, with some sort of papers. Orcutt’s
willing to punch citizen, but has serious
doubts about punching policeman. Says it’s
all mistake: doesn’t owe anybody in Cambridge.”
All of which I carefully entered in
the book, exactly as it was given to me.</p>

<p>“See here, Millar!” Kenryck shouted, as
he caught the sound of laughter from overhead,
“do <i>you</i> know anything about this
business?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
“I think I do, a little&mdash;if not a good
deal,” admitted that young man in a choked
sort of voice, grinning down at us through
an embrasure. “Yes, I think I’m in a fairly
good position for understanding the whole
complication.”</p>

<p>“Humph! if it’s so almightily funny I
fancy we’d better have more light on it,”
said Kenryck, with much dignity. “We’ll
flag over&mdash;‘<i>Instructions coming: wait!</i>’&mdash;and
then I’ll trouble you to explain the
meaning of all this foolishness.”</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” said the signalman, appearing
at the parapet wall, after starting
Kenryck’s order upon its travels: “Orcutt
and I&mdash;you may have noticed it&mdash;look almost
enough alike to be taken for twins,
especially since he’s forced out that moustache
of his. And that’s the key to the
mystery.”</p>

<p>“Give the key a twist, then,” said Kenryck.
“Proceed with your exposition.”</p>

<p>“To continue,” obediently went on the
young man, “<i>I’m</i> the party for whom this
Boardman is out gunning. He keeps a place
where a lot of the students have club-tables,
and I used to belong to a club of fellows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
resorted there for nourishment&mdash;which, I
may state, was not of the highest grade,
though we paid a princely price for it. Well,
last winter I had to be away from college for
about three weeks, and I left without giving
notice to Boardman. Which resulted in two
claims: Boardman’s, that I owed him thirty
dollars for three weeks’ un-eaten grub&mdash;and
<i>mine</i>, that he ought to be struck by lightning
for his superhuman nerve.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I have the clue now,” said Kenryck.
“Come, let’s get to work on straightening
out things. Pick up your flag, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But that’s not quite all of it,” interrupted
the occupant of the turret. “You see, this
man Boardman isn’t a pleasant person to
have dealings with. He’s very rough-tongued,
and never sand-papers down his
sentences. And the last time we argued
over our differences I was so displeased by
his lack of breeding that I&mdash;well, he made
me hot under my collar, and I hit him just
above <i>his</i>. See?”</p>

<p>“Oho! he’s after you for assault, is he?”
said Kenryck. “That’s pleasant for Orcutt!”</p>

<p>“Yes, for assault&mdash;and battery,” assented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Millar. “And I judge that it may be <i>very</i>
pleasant for Orcutt. For Boardman swore
that he’d get square with me some day, and
I fancy&mdash;though the reports from across the
river don’t go much into details&mdash;that he’s
considerably in earnest about doing the
squaring-up without any farther delay.”
And, in spite of the seriousness of the
situation, he gave way to another fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” said Kenryck, frowning darkly
upon his subordinate, “all this is amazingly
ludicrous, isn’t it? But you’ll have an aching
arm, just the same, before you get
through with swinging that bamboo stick of
yours: for we’ve got to flag this story over
to Cambridge&mdash;and a very pretty bit of flagging
it’ll make! Come, we’ve kept the
other lads long enough on pins and needles
and anxious seats: we must get to work.”</p>

<p>The message to be sent was a long one. I
sat down upon Kenryck’s chair, pulled out
my tobacco pouch, and charged my pipe
afresh, for there seemed to be nothing requiring
my immediate attention. Minute
slipped after minute, while Kenryck’s voice
kept along in steady monotone, and the bunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
above our heads&mdash;whirring and flapping
in intermittent accompaniment&mdash;busily went
on with the task of changing the spoken
words into the symbols of the code.</p>

<p>“There, that’ll keep the hill men busy for a
time,” Kenryck observed, when the flag upon
the turret gave a final downward sweep and
then became still. “Phew! it was a long
pull.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you cut your middle station
out of the circuit?” I asked. “It would
save time if you did your talking direct.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t think of it,” he replied. “These
boys are out for practical instruction, and
I’m bound to see that they get it&mdash;<i>all</i> of
’em.”</p>

<p>“Queer mix-up, isn’t it?” said I, with a
laugh. “Wish I could have seen the proceedings
at the other end of the line.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the signal lieutenant, joining
in my laughter; “but I’m afraid this last
message has spoiled the fun over there.
Well, perhaps it had gone far enough.”</p>

<p>“‘B’ station has finished transmitting,
sir,” announced the youth above us. “Cambridge
has just made ‘O.K.’”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Kenryck, lining his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
glasses upon the opposite terminal. “Now
we’ll get some results.”</p>

<p>“All ready,” said I, pulling my pencil
from behind my ear and adjusting my note-book.
“Let it come.”</p>

<p>There was an interval of waiting, but at
last the opposite tower began to talk, and, as
Kenryck passed the words to me, I spread
upon the page this remarkable entry:</p>

<p>“Told Boardman mistake. Says he knows
better. Also, that we’re blanked liars. Orcutt
very uneasy: growing insubordinate.
Proposes to smash Boardman and policeman
too. Tried to pitch loose tiles down upon
their heads. I stopped him. Tower door
locked on our side. Which prevents murder.
Lieutenant better come over at once.”</p>

<p>This was cheeringly warlike. I burst into
a roar of ill-timed mirth, while Kenryck laid
down his glasses and strode back and forth
upon the roof, giving profane utterance to
his perplexity and paying no heed to the
calling-off of the signals from the hill.</p>

<p>I read over my last entry in the book, and
roared again, which caused Kenryck to pause
in his tramping, glare at me, and snap out,
“Can’t you let me think? I’ve got to call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
halt in this business somehow&mdash;and there
you sit, braying like a Himalayan donkey,
and rattling the last idea out of me! How
about those car-load lots of advice? Come,
suggest something!”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” said I, very earnestly.
“This is your affair, and I’d never venture
to hint that you’re not more than able to
swing it alone. You’ve managed it beautifully
so far as you’ve gone. But unless you
want your corps to come in for a heap of free
advertising in tomorrow’s papers, you’d do
well to make another move&mdash;and a quick
one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call for a cab, and go over there myself,”
announced Kenryck, with a vicious
stamp upon the tiles, “and, by The Great
Indian! when I <i>do</i> get there I’ll give everybody&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now just hold hard for a minute, my son,”
I put in at this point. “Consider things
calmly. What’s the use of going to all that
bother? Besides, it would cost you all of
three large dollars&mdash;and you can’t draw
mileage for that kind of travelling. There’s
a much easier and less troublesome way out
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“Let’s have it then!” sputtered Kenryck.
“You set yourself up to be a sort of lawyer,
don’t you? Well, here’s an elegant chance
to show your quality.”</p>

<p>“I am a lawyer,” said I, with unassuming
dignity; “a young but very subtle one. And
since it’s your wish that I should be of counsel
in this case, why, I’ll settle your matter
very speedily for you&mdash;and at something
off from my usual rates. In fact, I’ll call it
a charity job, and make no charge whatever.
Now, pay attention to what I’m telling you.
Here’s what you’ll do: order your sergeant
to keep Orcutt quiet&mdash;if there’s no more
convenient method, he may tip him over and
sit on him&mdash;until I can&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Yes</i>, he may!” put in Kenryck, in a highly
aggravating tone. “Why, Orcutt weighs well
up towards two hundred, besides being as full
of temper as a razor blade&mdash;and the sergeant’s
a little man!”</p>

<p>“Will you hear me out, you gibberer?” I
inquired gently. “I don’t care how you
manage it, but I want you to see to it that
matters are kept <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in statu quo</i>, until I come
back. Understand? I’ll be gone only a minute.”
And I gracefully lowered myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
through the trap, and went rattling down the
many flights of stairs that twist their way up
through the tower’s dusky interior.</p>

<p>By rare good fortune I reached the ground
floor without breakage of bones, and straightway
made for the staff-room, where I hastily
rummaged through my desk until I came
upon a thin, black volume, emblazoned with
the arms of the State, and inscribed in golden
letters, “Militia Law.” Hastily running
over its pages I found what I needed: and
then, turning down the leaf, I thrust the book
into my pocket, and started off for my second
ascent into mid-air.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Ken.,” I cried, as I scrambled
breathless out upon the roof. “I’ve
brought you a bomb, and you can chuck it
over into Cambridge as soon as you please.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been long enough in getting it,”
was his ungracious response. “It wouldn’t
take more than five or six of your ‘minutes’
to make an hour. Come, trot out your alleged
bomb. Time’s precious.”</p>

<p>Withering Kenryck with a single expressive
glance, I slowly drew out my little black
book, opened it at the marked place, and said,
“It would be serving you no more than properly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
you ungrateful beggar, if I should draw
out of this case altogether, and leave you up
the tree! I may have taken a few seconds
over a minute, but I’m willing to give plump
odds that&mdash;going and coming&mdash;I’ve made
a new regimental record in tower climbing.
Well, here’s the medicine for your man Boardman&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must excuse me, old chap,” said
Kenryck hurriedly. “I dare say you tobogganed
down on the banisters, and galloped
up again on all-fours&mdash;but you certainly
seemed a devil of a time in doing it.”</p>

<p>“Chapter three-sixty-seven, section one-nineteen,
of the Revised Statutes,” I began,
after receiving this graceful and ample apology,
“would seem to furnish both the authority
and the means for the abatement of this
nuisance of which you make complaint. It
runneth thuswise: ‘If any person interrupts
or molests or insults, by abusive words or behavior,
or obstructs any officer or soldier
while on duty or at any parade or drill, he
may be put immediately under guard and
kept at the discretion of the commanding
officer of the detachment until the duty is
concluded: and such commanding officer may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
turn over such person to any police officer or
constable of the city or town: and said police
officer or constable shall detain him in custody
for examination and trial: and any person
found guilty of either of the offences
enumerated in this section shall be punished
by imprisonment in the jail or house of correction
not exceeding six months, or by fine
not exceeding one hundred dollars.’”</p>

<p>I flatter myself that I must have read this
tangle of clauses with truly judicial emphasis
and solemnity, for&mdash;when I came to the end
of it, and demanded, “How’s that?”&mdash;Kenryck
gave a yell of delight, and shouted,
“Out at the plate, by Jupiter!” And the
youth upon the turret displayed such violent
symptoms of joy that I feared lest he should
tumble from his dizzy perch.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s too good to be true,” gasped
Kenryck, after a prolonged paroxysm of
laughter. “It fits like an old glove, too!
Well, here goes for trying it on: I’ll send
over the whole blessed section, though it’ll
make an outrageously long message, and
order the sergeant to spout it down at ’em
from the tower. Jumping Jonah! <i>won’t</i> it do
’em up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
“It’s a beautiful bit of rhetoric,” said I,
glancing through the passage again; “there
are just twelve <i>or’s</i> in it&mdash;enough to fit out
a ‘varsity eight and two single scullers. But
I consider that it will answer your purpose
very cleverly.”</p>

<p>I handed over the book, pointed out the
all-powerful section, and sat down, more than
well pleased with my share in the proceedings.
Kenryck explored the interior of
his braided blouse, discovered a cigar, and
silently handed it to me&mdash;an action which
proclaimed more eloquently than words his
deep appreciation of the value of my services.</p>

<p>The transmission of this lengthy quotation
from the law of the land took some little
time. My cigar burned slowly on until half
its original bulk had fallen away in ashes
before we caught the first signal in reply to
our communication. But the response, when
finally it came, made us speedily forget the
time we had spent in awaiting it.</p>

<p>“Stand by to register,” cautioned Kenryck,
who for several minutes of silence had been
sharply scanning the far-off tower. I hurriedly
drew out my knife, and put a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
point upon my pencil. “There she blows!
Ready are you? Then score up <span class="locked">this&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘Have quoted law. No go! Boardman
says law may be dash-double-blanked, and
men who made it may be blank-double-dashed.
Policeman says law doesn’t concern
him: his orders are to arrest on warrant. Big
crowd gathered in street, guying us. Situation
something awful. Orcutt in open mutiny.
Will Lieutenant <i>please</i> come?’”</p>

<p>This was sufficiently definite, surely. Kenryck
turned and stared blankly at me. Out
of respect for his feelings I refrained from
laughing.</p>

<p>“When you get that message from the
hill,” he shouted to the man upon the turret,
“make your acknowledgment signal, and
then send over word that I’m coming. Can
you do it alone?” And, upon receiving an
affirmative answer, he made for the trap in
the roof and disappeared.</p>

<p>I hastily stuffed the note-book into my
pocket, and followed him. Down the shaking
stairs we went, at a neck-or-nothing pace, until
we landed at the bottom. And then Kenryck
shot himself into the armorer’s room, and
dropped into the chair before the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
<i>Br-r-r-r!</i> went the little bell. “Hello!
Central? Give me Cambridge, please.” A
pause. “This Cambridge? Well, will you
give me the chief of police?” Another and
a longer wait. “Hello! You the chief of
Cambridge police? I’m Kenryck&mdash;Lieutenant
Kenryck&mdash;commanding signal corps,
third volunteer brigade. Got that? <i>Yes!</i>
Well, I’ve sent a detail over to Memorial
Hall, under duty orders. Now, my men are
being interfered with and insulted by a citizen.
There’s a curious sort of mistake.”
Here he put in an elaborate explanation.
“But the thing must be stopped, right away.
I make formal complaint to you, under section&mdash;wait
a second, please.”</p>

<p>I supplied him with chapter and verse for
the text of his discourse, and he went on,
“Under section one-nineteen, chapter three-sixty-seven,
of the statutes. And I want you
to take this citizen&mdash;<i>yes</i>, Boardman’s his
name, but I don’t know the initials&mdash;into
custody until I can come over to attend to
him. What’s that? You’d like to look up
the statute? All right&mdash;only kindly be
quick about it.”</p>

<p>Then came a long interval. I ventured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
say a word or two, but Kenryck turned upon
me a warning scowl which reduced me at once
to silence. “Hello!” he finally sang out, in
answer to some communication over the wire.
“You’ll see that your men take care of him?
That’s good. Thanks! Hope we may be able
to do as much for <i>you</i>, some day. I’ll be
over later. Good day.”</p>

<p>He hung the receiver upon its hook, rang
off, and rose from his seat, smiling like one
who feels conscious of having done a clever
thing. “It’s a poor law,” said he, “that can’t
be worked both ways.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the law may be likened unto a
double-edgéd sword&mdash;and woe upon them
that monkey therewith!” I replied. “And
now what?”</p>

<p>“Now we’ll scale the tower again,” announced
Kenryck, “to await developments.
And, unless I’m wide in my guess, we’ll find
things running <i>our</i> way when we get our
next news from over the river.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going over, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Kenryck very decidedly; “not
if I know myself. It would cost me all of
three large dollars&mdash;and one can’t draw
mileage for that sort of travelling.” By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
which I was led to believe that a part, at
least, of my advice had not fallen upon stony
ground.</p>

<p>“I shall let the police gather in my man,”
he went on, as we panted up the last steep
flight of stairs, “and then, after the siege has
been raised, telephone over that I’ll not press
the charge against him. How’ll that do?”</p>

<p>We climbed out, one after the other, upon
the roof. Kenryck in a few words explained
to his signalman what had been done, and
then we sat down to await the final report.
It was not a long waiting. In less than ten
minutes the bit of color upon the Cambridge
tower began its weird dance and, signal by
signal, industriously sent across to us these
tidings of comfort and joy:</p>

<p>“Patrol wagon just sailed up! Boardman
bundled into it, speechless with rage. Policeman
gone, too. Crowd has applauded
operations and mostly dispersed. Orcutt
manageable again&mdash;and coast clear.”</p>

<p>I shook hands with Kenryck. The youth
upon the turret&mdash;who, without waiting for
the hill station to repeat, had translated all
this for his own benefit&mdash;waved his flag
madly ‘round his head, and then hugged himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
with delight. And we all three roared
in chorus and loudly.</p>

<p>“We’ll let it go at that,” said Kenryck
finally, “and call it a day’s work. Make your
signal for closing stations, Millar, and pack
up your kit. Here,” as he happened to look
in my direction, “you can’t have those!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can,” said I, folding up and
stowing away in my pocket the two leaves
that I had just torn from the note-book.
“Of course I can have ’em. Aren’t they in
my own handwriting? And besides, they’ll
be useful&mdash;labelled ‘Exhibits <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>’&mdash;when
I’m retained to defend you against a
suit for false imprisonment.”</p>

<p>But the suit has never been brought, and
the stolen leaves lie undisturbed, pasted side
by side in the big scrap-book which rests
upon the top of the bookcase, up in The Battery.
Ask Sam to hunt them out for you,
when next you happen to find yourself up
there.</p>

<h2>ONE FROM THE VETERAN.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">“Everything’s</span> calm,” said the lieutenant-colonel,
“and apparently liable
to stay so. I’ve been through
the whole brigade&mdash;’way down to the cavalry
quarters, and back through the gunners’ and
infantry camps&mdash;and the peacefulness of
things reminds me of the old nursery jingle,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘And all through the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a creature was stirring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even a mouse.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Well, this tour of mine’s been an easy one.
I’ve been under canvas with the old brigade
for just nineteen rolling years, and so when
I say that this camp walks right away with
the trophy for quietness, I’m speaking by the
card.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a pious idea if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to turn in, then?” inquired the adjutant, adding
to his remark a suggestive and very audible
yawn. “Field officers of the day aren’t
supposed to sit up all night&mdash;at least, not in
time of peace. I’m feeling just a wee bit
sleepy myself.”</p>

<p>Midnight had come and gone. The camp
lay silent, its snowy tents looming out dimly
in the faint, midsummer starlight. Not a
murmur hinted at the presence of the three
thousand sleeping men hidden away beneath
the shimmering whiteness of the canvas. The
sleepy sentry pacing slowly to and fro before
regimental headquarters seemed only a deeper
shade in the shadowy picture. His measured
tread upon the dew-dampened turf roused no
echo.</p>

<p>There came into view a spectral shape,
striding rapidly towards the quarters of the
non-commissioned staff. “Hi!” called the
lieutenant-colonel softly. “<i>Hi!</i> that you,
Sam?”</p>

<p>At this challenge the spectre changed its
course and approached the adjutant’s tent, in
front of which, and under the protecting fly,
the two officers were sitting. “Yes, it’s me,”
answered the voice of the veteran orderly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
The Third. “That you, Col’n’l Wentworth?
Anything I can do for ye?”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to know why you’re prowling
’round at this time of night,” said the
lieutenant-colonel mildly. “You’re old
enough to be setting the boys a better example.”</p>

<p>“I judge ye’re correct, Col’n’l,” assented
Sam, still standing attention in front of the
tent. “I’d oughter be in quarters. But
down in B Comp’ny’s street I run’d onto a
feller that was in the war. Now, them fellers
is gittin’ scarcer’n honest men in the city
gov’nment, an’ so it follered that we got to
yarnin’, give an’ take, turn an’ turn about,
’til we clean lost track o’ the time.”</p>

<p>It might be well to mention here that Sam
is <i>the</i> privileged character of the Third Infantry.
It has been explained elsewhere how
Colonel Elliott discovered the old man enjoying
his well-earned <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">otium cum dig.</i> in the
Soldiers’ Home, down at Old Point. It also
has been told how, by a risky bit of work,
back in ’64, he won the Medal of Honor which
he wears upon the breast of his dress-coat.
To be sure, he guesses, “Bein’ nothin’ but
copper, ’taint worth much”&mdash;but by the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of the Old Regiment it is held at a somewhat
higher valuation.</p>

<p>Now, the customs of The Third do not
tend to encourage the spinning of yarns by
enlisted men in officers’ quarters, but to this
well-established rule there is one exception.
That exception is made in favor of Sam. And
since his webs of fact and fancy are woven,
for the most part, after darkness has descended
upon the face of the earth, the breach
of service etiquette is not sufficiently evident
to be demoralizing. All of which is explanatory.</p>

<p>The adjutant stepped back into the depths
of his tent, and presently returned with a
fistful of cigars and an extra camp-stool.
“Set ye, Sam,” said he, appropriating one of
the veteran’s pet idioms. “Set ye, and lend
a hand at smudging out mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>The old orderly borrowed a light from the
lieutenant-colonel, and seated himself, with
his elbows resting upon his knees and his
hands comfortably clasped before him. “I’ve
bin a-thinkin’,” said he, “how this milishy
business has changed since I was a boy.
Never happened to see an ol’-fashioned muster,
did ye? Nat’rally not. Ah, them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the days o’ plumes an’ swords, an’ gingerbread
an’ rum, an’ <i>genuine</i> patriotism!”</p>

<p>The adjutant, forgetting the darkness,
winked at the lieutenant-colonel. Wentworth
rose, stepped outside for a final survey of the
sleeping-camp, and then returned to his place.
“There were giants in those days, eh?” he
said, turning up the collar of his great-coat.</p>

<p>“Yes, ther’ was,” said Sam, impressively,
“ther’ was indeed. An’ giant-killers, too.
Ol’ Col’n’l Leatherbee was a giant. You’d
oughter seen <i>him</i>! Six-foot-two, he was.
My land! he was a rare sight when he was in
his milishy togs, with his boots an’ spurs, an’
his buff breeches, an’ his blue coat with buff
facin’s, an’ his flamin’ red sash, an’ his terruble
long sword, an’ his high shako, with the
wavin’ plume a-top an’ the soarin’ brass eagle
on the front of it.” Sam paused for lack of
breath.</p>

<p>“An’ Maj’r Otis Prouty was another giant,”
he continued. “I’ve told ye how the Maj’r
trounced ol’ Col’n’l Leatherbee, up to Lond’nderry
muster. No? Oh, that was a tremenjous
battle,” he chuckled softly to himself,
“a tremenjous battle while it lasted.”</p>

<p>“<i>So?</i>” queried the adjutant. “Was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the custom for junior field-officers to thump
their chiefs?”</p>

<p>“Gen’rally, no,” said Sam. “As a rule
’twa’nt a safe undertakin’, ’cause the men that
rose up to be col’n’ls was men that run’d to
pritty large sizes. Ol’ Leatherbee was a man
o’ consid’able breadth an’ heft. But he was
some lackin’ in sperrit. O-ho! he cert’nly
<i>was</i> lackin’ o’ gimp. An’ the time when Otis
Prouty tipped him over was only one o’ two
times that he was downed with all four p’ints
a-touchin’. For ther’ was another time ’sides
that ’un.” And here the old gunner again
laughed softly over some remembrance.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to tell ye. ’Twas like
this: the ol’ Col’n’l, a’ter runnin’ in single
harness for nigh onto fifty year, had to go an’
git himself married. Not that ’twa’n’t right
for him to do’t; the Scriptures has established
the principle that ’taint well for man to be
alone. Only, mistakes sometimes happens.
An’ Col’n’l Leatherbee added one more mistake
to the list when he went an’ had himself
mattermonially yoked with Tildy Pettus. By
doin’ which he shown the beauty o’ the tex’
which states that fools goes a-rushin’ in
where angels is ’fraid o’ bein’ entertained
unawares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
“I said, didn’t I, that ol’ Leatherbee was a
giant? Wal, Tildy, <i>she</i> was a giant-killer!
’Fore she was promoted to the command o’
the Col’n’l’s establishment she used to be a
school-ma’am. An’ if she didn’t rule her
little, red-painted institution o’ learnin’ with
a rod of iron ’twas only ’cause birch-rods
come cheaper an’ handier, besides bein’, when
sci’ntifically applied to youthful students,
more blisterin’ than iron in a highly-het condition.
Oh, she made a great name for herself
as a discipliner, an’ when she quit teachin’,
the boys an’ girls o’ that time felt that life
still had some sweetness left for the down-trodden
an’ oppressed. They likewise made
existence a burnin’ torment for the nex’
teacher, which happened to be a dyspepsic
striplin’ from somewheres down-country.</p>

<p>“Now, Tildy Pettus&mdash;I mean Mis’ Col’n’l
Leatherbee&mdash;were ’thout doubt a good looker.
She wa’n’t tall; the ol’ Col’n’l useter say, ‘She
aint long for this world’&mdash;meanin’ that she
stood ’bout five-foot-three in her high-heeled
slippers. Her cheeks was quite red an’
attractive, an’ she was plump an’ wholesome
to the eye. But ther’ useter be a kind o’
furrow that’d crease itself down ’twixt her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
eyebrows when things didn’t go just to suit
her, an’ when that occurred, which wa’n’t unfrequent,
them that knew her took it for a
sign that ’twas ’bout time to display the
better part o’ valor&mdash;which, so we’re told, is
discretion. For Tildy had a tongue&mdash;a <i>sharp</i>
’un&mdash;an’ a copious dictionary to draw words
from when the sperrit moved her to the usin’
on ’em.</p>

<p>“Not that, in speakin’ o’ the sharpness o’
the female tongue, I’m castin’ any reflections
on wimmin-kind <i>as</i> such,” explained Sam.
“Lor’ knows I’ve been admirin’ wimmin more
or less for better’n half a century. But some
on ’em, havin’ tongues o’ great keenness,
makes remarks which cuts most distressful.
An’ yet, if female tongues be keen, the male
tongue often is blunt; an’ I haint yet quite
made up my mind whether it hurts the worst to
be cut by a sharp tongue or bruised black-an’-blue
by a blunt ’un. It’s some’at a’ter the
fashion o’ politics&mdash;‘Both the Old Parties
has grave defec’s in their make-up.’</p>

<p>“Wal, Mis’ Leatherbee settled down as
commandin’ officer o’ the big, white house
wherein the Col’n’l hitherto had reigned
alone, in fancy meditatin’ free. An’ lackin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
her former exercise o’ disciplinin’ scholars,
an’ havin’ no childern of her own to put
through a course o’ sprouts, she fell into the
way o’ providin’ herself with amusement by
a-teachin’ her husband of his P’s an’ Q’s.
An’ this was very entertainin’ for the both
on ’em. For she’d bin used to seein’ her
dear little pupils set up an’ take notice when
she spoke to ’em; while the Col’n’l&mdash;wal,
he’d bin accustomed to doin’ pritty much
whatever he darn’ pleased, an’ furthermore
had got well sot in the habit. However, like
most men that gits married late in life, he
was fond of his wife, an’ when she didn’t go
for to nag him too hard they managed to jolt
along together well’s most married folks.</p>

<p>“Now, one o’ the Col’n’l’s pet habits, I
must tell ye, was to employ a consid’able
share of his evenin’s, durin’ the winter, in
settin’ into a congenial cotery which was in
the way o’ gatherin’ themselves together
’round the fire-place at the ta-avern. He
were a man o’ some prom’nence in them
parts, an’ what he said carried great weight,
he havin’ bin to the legislatur’ for a couple o’
terms, an’ havin’ bin selec’man time out o’
mind, ’sides havin’ held ’most every title in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the milishy ’ceptin’ jigadier-brindle&mdash;which
is what the boys useter call the brigadier
gen’ral. So his remarks nat’rally was
received with great respec’, an’ when he
explained the strategematical mistakes that
was made by both sides durin’ the Revolution
an’ the War of 1812, ther’ wa’n’t no
one that felt called upon to set up a very
vehemient opinion to the contrariwise. ’Specially
while he was a-settin’ up o’ the rum,
which, for to give him his dues, he done as a
rule, an’ freely; sometimes so freely that
when it come breakin’-up time, both him an’
his constituents would be a-showin’ sympt’ms
o’ coagulation o’ the speech.</p>

<p>“From all o’ which it follers that in some
ways ol’ Leatherbee was the darn’est man ye
ever seen. Which bein’ so, his wife must o’
necess’ty bin the nex’ to the darn’est. In the
first place, ’twa’n’t proper nor ’cordin’ to the
rules o’ polite behavior for him, havin’ saturated
his system with ol’ Santy Crooze extracts,
to go home an’ try to convince Mis’
Leatherbee that, if he’d bin in command o’
the American forces, the maraudin’ British
wouldn’t never’ve had occasion to make a
hollowcost o’ the city o’ Washin’ton; because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
she, not bein’ a soldier, couldn’t be expected
to take no int’rest in topics o’ them kind,
’specially at the untimely hour o’ night at
which they usually was brought up for her
consid’ration. <i>And</i> which bein’ all granted,
’twa’n’t, in the second place, hardly good taste
on her part to address such remarks to her
errin’ spouse as she sometimes allowed herself
for to do; ’cause, if he wa’n’t her superior,
he cert’nly was her senior. An’ no man o’
proper respec’ for himself enjoys bein’ called,
earnest-like, a ’sozzlin’ soak.’ This ye may
set down for a fac’, sure’s ye’re a foot high.</p>

<p>“P’raps I’m goin’ too heavy into details,
an’ not figgerin’ my account down to a p’int
fine enough to match the lateness o’ the
hour. But I’ve told ye enough, anyways,
to make it evident that the affairs o’ the
Leatherbee household was runnin’ along in
a fashion that was bound to wind up in a
climax sometime. An’ finally the climax
come, the arrival of it bein’ somewhat in
thiswise:</p>

<p>“’Twas on a terruble stormy night, ’long
towards the end o’ Jan’ary. The ol’ Col’n’l
had went down to the ta-avern uncommon
early, an’ had evened things up by stayin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
more’n respectable late. So when he fin’lly
got himself boosted out’n his chair by the
fire, an’ started off to go home, clean to
t’other end o’ the town, the clock in the
steeple o’ the Orthodox church had got
through with the business o’ knockin’ out
midnight an’ was a-puttin’ up its hands to
strike the next hour which might happen to
come along that way, feelin’ confident, as ye
might say, that it could send it to sleep in
one round.</p>

<p>“‘Col’n’l,’ says the ol’ man to himself, as
he went ploughin’ along through the snow,
‘Col’n’l, ye have tarried too long with the
serpint which do lurk in the wine-cup.’ This,
however, wa’n’t stric’ly true, ’cause ther’
hadn’t bin no wine at all connected with
the evenin’s entertainment, he havin’ confined
his attention exclusive to rum-an’-molasses.</p>

<p>“‘Col’n’l Leatherbee,’ says he again, a
little further on, ‘I’ve sore misgivin’s in
regards to the reception that’s a-waitin’ ye
yonder.’ It was a great trick o’ the ol’
man’s to talk to himself when a-laborin’
under stimulous excitement. But he always
done it respectful, never allowin’ himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
forgit the position in the community which
he held. At the proper time an’ place he
was able an’ willin’ to swear the legs off’n
an iron pot; but he never swore at himself,
nor at his wife, neither.</p>

<p>“‘I must be firm in the hour of adversity,’
says he, when he had steered himself far’s
his own gate. ‘“Budge not, lest ye be
budged” shall be my motter. I will be
silent under the wrath to come. It is written
that strong waters run deep; <i>I</i> will run
deep also.’ This is what he actu’lly said. I
know it, because the ol’ man had bin talkin’
in a very deep tone, so’s to give himself all
the courage possible, an’ the lan’lord o’ the
ta-avern heard every blessed word, he havin’
follered the Col’n’l far’s his door, to make
sure that he didn’t lay himself down to slumber
in no snow-drift, arguin’ that he were too
valuable a customer to be careless of.</p>

<p>“Wal, Col’n’l Leatherbee navigated careful
acrost the door-yard, leavin’ a trail as
crooked as if’t had bin made by the serpint
which he’d mentioned, but the beautiful
snow come down an’ covered the tracks,
so’s they shouldn’t set the neighbors to talkin’
next mornin’. An’ that was the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
seen o’ the Col’n’l, that night, by any mortal
eye ’ceptin’ his wife’s. However, the rest
o’ what I’m goin’ to tell ye sets on a pritty
good foundation, for it comes direc’ from
Mis’ Leatherbee herself, she havin’ bin so
tickled by the subsequence of events that
she just couldn’t keep her mouth shet, an’
had to go trottin’ over to tell the whole
story to her nex’ best friend. By which
channels the report was duly an’ officially
promulgated.</p>

<p>“After wrastlin’ successful with the latch
o’ the door, the ol’ man ushered himself into
the house. An’ then, havin’ pulled off his
boots an’ dumped his big coat, snow an’ all,
down onto the floor, he slipped into the
sleepin’-room an’ begun to diverge himself
from the rest of his clothin’. Everythin’
went fust-rate for a while, not a whisper
comin’ from the big four-posted bedstid to
disturb his nerves. But Mis’ Leatherbee
was just layin’ low, like a masked batt’ry.
An’ all of a sudden she opened onto him.</p>

<p>“My gor-<i>ri</i>! She begun with solid shot,
an’ then changed off onto percussion shell,
an’ fin’lly started a-servin’ out canister. The
tempest outside had bin doin’ tol’able lively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
work up to this p’int; but when Mis’ Leatherbee
got fairly het up to the occasion the
wind give a last despairin’ howl, an’ went
switchin’ down the valley an’ into the nex’
township, like it owned up that it wa’n’t runnin’
no opposition to the rumpus she was
a-raisin.’</p>

<p>“The ol’ Col’n’l, he were took completely
by su’prise, bein’, as it were, off’n his guard.
He’d bin expectin’ a to-do o’ some sort, but
the rakin’ he was a-gettin’ went clean beyond
his most cheerful calculations. For a minute
he stood stock an’ still in his tracks, plumb
dumb-foundered. An’ then his knees got
wobbly, an’ he sot down suddin on the floor,
for to collec’ his idees.</p>

<p>“So far it had bin a jug-handled discussion&mdash;meanin’
that all the talkin’ had bin
on one side. An’ as the ol’ man sot ther’ a-rummagin’
for thoughts, he come acrost his
original plan, layin’ tucked away safe an’
sound under the roof of his head, an’ recollected
that he wa’n’t a-goin’ to say nothin’,
no matter what happened.</p>

<p>“But, ’stid of abatin’, the roarin’ whirlwind
of abuse kep’ growin’ stronger, an’ the
Col’n’l kind o’ lost <span class="locked">sight”&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
“<i>S-st!</i>” broke in the adjutant, raising his
hand, and leaning forward. “Hear anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes; sabres a-clinkin’,” answered Sam
promptly, cocking his head to one side and
peering out into the gloom. “Ye can’t fool
me on that sound; I’ve heard it too often,
farther south than we be now. Guess likely
it’s the provo’s.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant-colonel stepped out from
beneath the tent-fly, and went to meet a little
squad which was making its way up from the
left of the line. After a moment’s parley he
returned to the tent, and the shadowy group
moved on, the clank of the sabres sounding
more faintly as the troopers vanished into the
darkness. “Two of the provost-guard, running
in a tramp found asleep back of the
cavalry stables,” he explained, as he seated
himself. “Proceed with your fiction, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Queer, how them tramps always hang
’round volunteer camps, aint it?” said Sam.
“Ther’ aint nothin’ in it for ’em, ’ceptin’ the
guard-house if they happens to git collared.
An’ yit they turn up reg’lar, year in an’ year
out. Must be they’re sent providentially
for to give practice to the provo’s. Le’ me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
see; where was I? O, yes; ye left we two
a-settin’ here, an’ ol’ Col’n’l Leatherbee a-settin’
on the floor of his bedroom, waitin’ for
the clouds to roll by. Wal, I’ll proceed, but
not with no fiction; what I’m given’ ye is
solemn an’ sacred fac’s.</p>

<p>“The clouds in the Leatherbee mansion,
’stid o’ rollin’ by, kep’ growin’ heavier an’
blacker, an’ Mis’ Leatherbee’s stock of ammunition
didn’t show no signs o’ runnin’ low.
So fin’lly the ol’ Col’n’l’s dander begun to
come up, an’ ’fore he knew it, he’d forgot
that he were goin’ to suffer all things in uncomplainin’
silence.</p>

<p>“‘Mis’ Leatherbee,’ says he, ‘my dear
mad’m, like the wintry snow, we are driftin’&mdash;<i>hic!</i>&mdash;driftin’
apart. At the present moment
we’re as far apart’s the two ends of a
stick. Which means bein’ sep’rated as widely’s
the feeble human intellec’ can conceive.’
Now, anybody with eleven idees to the inch
might have seen that the ol’ man wa’n’t in no
condition to pass remarks with his good lady;
but, oncet havin’ got fair started, he progressed
right along, regardless o’ the fac’ that he were
violatin’ the agreement he’d made with himself
previous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
“‘’Tis best that we should end this painful
interview,’ he says, a-climbin’ up onto
his mutinous legs. ‘Alas! ther’ aint but one
way, an’ that a awful&mdash;<i>hic!</i>&mdash;awful gashly
one! But ye’ve drove me to’t. I ther’fore
bid ye farewell, Mis’ Leatherbee. I also trust
that your few remainin’ years may be cheered
by no remorse. Your very respectful an’
obedient servant, Nathan Leatherbee, Col’n’l
commandin’ Tenth Reg’ment Milishy.’ This
may sound ridic’lous, but it’s word for word
what the ol’ man said. Honest! His brain
was so shooken-up by the razzlin’ he’d bin
gittin’ that he truly couldn’t tell whether he
were makin’ of a speech or writin’ of an
official letter.</p>

<p>“Wal, bein’ more or less firm established
on his feet, he zig-zagged himself out into the
kitchen, his house follerin’ the plan o’ most
country houses o’ that time, an’ havin’ a
thunderin’ big kitchen, with a lot o’ rooms
openin’ out of it. Here he sashayed over to
the cupb’d, an’ took out a slashin’ big carvin’
knife, an’ begun to whet it up on the steel
which went with it, makin’ more noise than
a hay-maker puttin’ an edge onto his scythe.
Mis’ Leatherbee had stopped talkin’, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
’twas plain to be seen that she were a-listenin’
to the proceedin’s.</p>

<p>“The ol’ Col’n’l fixed the knife to suit him,
an’ then slipped into the closet an’ fetched
out a ham which happened to be there, settin’
it down careful-like onto the table. ‘Mis’
Leatherbee, do ye relent?’ says he in a solemn
tone. If she did, she didn’t say so.
‘Ther’s yet time, ma’am,’ says he, pausin’ for
a reply. Not a word come from the bedroom;
the silence was truly appallin’.
‘Once more, then,’ says he, in a chokin’
voice, ‘an’ for the last time, farewell!’ An’,
with that, he plunked the carvin’ knife into
the ham, with a sick’nin’ <i>chug</i>, give a fearful
groan, an’ flopped down heavy onto the
floor.</p>

<p>“Now, ’twas gol-<i>dum</i> cold out ther’ in the
kitchin, an’, as I told ye, the Col’n’l had dispensed
with most of his clothin’ before bein’
drove to the committin’ of his rash deed.
Consequently, after layin’ ther’ in the dark
for a minute, he begun to have chills, an’, to
keep his teeth from chatterin’, he had to
groan some more, which he done this time in
good earnest. But Mis’ Leatherbee staid
comfortable in bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
“Wal, fin’lly Col’n’l Leatherbee give a
combination o’ groan an’ gasp an’ guggle that
fair rattled the dishes on the closet shelves.
An’ then his wife speaks up, an’ says, says
she, ‘Aint ye dead yet, <i>Mister</i> Leatherbee?’
To which he answered, truthful, ‘No; but
I’m tormented nigh to bein’!’&mdash;‘Hurry up
an’ die, then,’ says she, ‘I want to be gittin’
to sleep.’ An’ he heard her turnin’ over in
bed, an’ smoothin’ down her piller.</p>

<p>“That was the last straw that done the
giant-killin’ business. The ol’ man riz up
slow, leavin’ the murdered ham layin’ in its
gore on the table, an’ sneaked back into the
bedroom, an’ crawled in under the quilts,
feelin’ smaller’n a cent’s worth o’ soap a’ter a
week’s hard washin’. An’, for oncet in her
life, Mis’ Leatherbee had sense enough to
hold her raspin’ tongue, an’ let her husband
go to sleep in peace.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the relief,” said the lieutenant-colonel,
as the sentinel at headquarters
advanced to meet an approaching knot of
men, and sharply challenged, “<i>Halt! Who’s
there?</i>”</p>

<p>“Whew! then it’s two o’clock,” said
Sam, hastily rising. “Who’d have thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
it? This aint no sort o’ way for a man o’
my age to be a-keepin’ his roses fresh.”</p>

<p>“Any moral in all that?” asked the adjutant,
rising in his turn.</p>

<p>“No; nor nothin’ un-moral, neither,”
chuckled the veteran, raising his hand to his
cap in parting salute. “Which, in these
days, is good guarantee that ’twont never be
printed. Wal, good-night to ye.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>WOODLEIGH, Q.M.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Most</span> of us have cause for remembering
the hospitalities of The Fourth.
The same being an up-country regiment,
a visit to it involves a rail journey of
three hours and thirty times as many miles;
but, in view of what lies at the end of them,
the ninety miles and the three hours count
as nothing. For in The Fourth they know
how to do things properly.</p>

<p>The second battalion of The Fourth sent
out cards for a ball, last winter, and a round
dozen of them turned up in our mail at headquarters.
As a rule, we never allow an invitation
from that part of the world to go
unheeded; but this time we had to return
our really regretful regrets, because a meeting
of the council of officers had been ordered
for that particular night. It was too bad.</p>

<p>But The Third, if for nothing more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
old acquaintance’ sake, had to be represented.
And so the colonel, after thoughtfully considering
the varied attractions of the staff,
sent for the quartermaster&mdash;“Woodleigh,
Q.M.,” he signs himself, when the paper is
an official one&mdash;and, after loading him down
with his blessing and our compliments to the
fellows of the other corps, regretfully saw
him start off alone towards the scene of
impending festivities. “Woodleigh’s a fine
shape of man,” the colonel argued to himself,
“and he’ll do for a sample of the rest of us.
Besides, what earthly sort of use <i>are</i> quartermasters,
except for ornament?” So off went
Woodleigh to the ball.</p>

<p>In course of time he came back again, telling
strange things about what had happened
to him during his absence.</p>

<p>“About that ball?” said he, on a night
in the following week, when a half-dozen of
us had bunched ourselves before one of old
Sam’s master-pieces of fire-building, up in
The Battery. “Oh, well, it was a big ball, a
broad-and-wide ball, a very large ball indeed.
You missed it by not going. The armory
was decorated right up to the vanishing-point&mdash;out
of sight, in fact. There were brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
twelve-pounders on each side of the Governor’s
box, like signs to call attention to the
big guns inside of it; and there were oceans
of bunting; and all the regimental colors
that The Fourth has had issued to it in the
last thirty years; and jungles of palms and
other green things; and girls&mdash;yes, there
were girls, of course.</p>

<p>“There was <i>one</i> girl&mdash; Never mind: that
wouldn’t interest you fellows. But perhaps
you’d like to hear about the supper. There
was a very nourishing supper, so they tell
me. I didn’t stay for it, though.”</p>

<p>With our knowledge of the quartermaster’s
customary prowess at the banquet table, this
last statement seemed to call for farther explanation.
We ventured to ask him about it.</p>

<p>“Why did I cut that supper? Well, because
I wanted to. Why did I want to?
H’m! you’re hot for information, aren’t you?
But perhaps I may as well tell you. If I
don’t, somebody else will; and if it has to be
told, I’d prefer to have it told truthfully.</p>

<p>“It was all on account of that girl&mdash;that
<i>one</i> girl. I’m not ashamed to admit that it
was a case of utter annihilation at first sight.
I had hardly stepped out upon the armory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
floor, when my eye fell on her; and from that
instant I knew that, for <i>me</i>, there wasn’t
another girl in that whole hall&mdash;no, nor in
the whole wide world. ‘See anybody you’d
like to meet?’ says Major Brayton, who
had me under his wing. ‘Yes, present me
to that stunning girl in yellow,’ says I, like
a flash; ‘that girl sitting over there beside
the stout woman in black.’ Confound Brayton!
he might have warned me. But he
didn’t: he only grinned and said ‘Perhaps
you’d better get Erwin to take you up. But
come along with me, I’ll risk it.’</p>

<p>“Whew! she <i>was</i> a tearing beauty. Big,
soft, brown eyes, and a regular cloud of
wavy, brown hair to match, and a general
effect of having just stepped out of one of
Gibson’s drawings. When the major presented
me, my heart was thumping like a
bass-drum. Fact! Her name? I didn’t
quite catch it. But I captured her card, and
signed contracts for a waltz, and some sort
of country-dance just after it, and another
waltz well along towards the end of the list.
How did I score her down on <i>my</i> card?
Why, I just scratched down ‘D’&mdash;which
might have stood for most anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
“Well, we floated through the waltz. It
was a treat, for she was a divine dancer, as
I’d thought she’d be. When the country-dance
came along, I suggested that we’d do
well to hunt up some place in the gallery from
which we could look down upon it, explaining
that I was a little weak in my minor
tactics, and really didn’t feel up to getting
tangled in any such complicated manœuvres
unless I had a book of directions with me.
So up to the gallery we went, and I found an
ideal corner, all hidden by bunting draperies,
and palms and things.</p>

<p>“And there we sat&mdash;just we two&mdash;in a
ready-made paradise of our own, utterly forgetful
of the crush of prancing idiots who
were toiling away on the floor below us.
H’m! I think I must have lost my head
completely. I said all sorts of things. As a
matter of fact, I can’t begin to remember
half what I <i>did</i> say. I only know that finally
the music stopped, and she rose with a sigh.
‘Can’t I steal this next dance?’ says I, taking
her card from her to see who the lucky
man was that had it. ‘No,’ says she softly,
‘I’m afraid that it wouldn’t be possible.’ I
glanced at the card, and for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
noticed that the next dance and fully two-thirds
of the others were labelled ‘<i>J.&nbsp;E.</i>’, in a
painfully distinct and careful hand.</p>

<p>“And while I was assimilating this interesting
fact, who should come blundering into
our little, private paradise but Jack Erwin,
first lieutenant of ‘C’, Fourth. You don’t
know him? Wish <i>I</i> didn’t! ‘Hello! Woodleigh,
old man,’ says he, grabbing my paw.
‘Found you at last. They told me you were
doing guard duty for me. Well, I’m waiting
to be congratulated.’</p>

<p>“‘I beg pardon, Jack,’ says I; ‘promotion?’
And then he laughed&mdash;one of those
silly, cheerful, lover’s laughs&mdash;and tucked
<i>my</i> girl’s slender little hand under his arm.
‘No,’ says he; ‘or, rather, yes. Hadn’t you
heard of my engagement?’ And he smiled
down on the girl in a way that made me wild
to toss him over the balcony railing.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t. I simply pulled myself together
as best I could, and shook hands with
him, and mumbled something or other to her,
and then watched them go strolling off together.
And just as they went out of sight
behind the palms, I saw her press closer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
him, and heard her say, ‘Oh, Jack, dear, I
thought you never <i>would</i> come!’</p>

<p>“That’s all I know about the ball. If
you’re still thirsting for points on it, I’ll refer
you to Whateley, of ‘H’ troop. He was
there. Danced all night, I believe, and generally
did his duty. Queer boy, Whateley!
It made me sorrowful to see him wasting his
time in that way, when he might have been
putting it in to better advantage. But then,
the ‘Yellow-Legs’ are always great on dismounted
duty; nothing short of ‘Boots-and-Saddles’
ever rattles a really and truly
volunteer trooper.”</p>

<p>Little Poore had wandered over to the bookcase,
and was standing before it, thumbing
over the pages of the latest adjutant-general’s
report. “The first lieutenant of <i>‘C’, Fourth</i>,
is here put down as one Wilkins,” he said,
turning towards us. “I don’t seem to find
the name of Erwin anywhere in the register.”</p>

<p>Woodleigh calmly looked over at him, and
then addressed the rest of us. “You’ll have
to excuse him. He hasn’t been with us long,
and doesn’t quite understand my ways,” he
explained. “Very likely he thought I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
have the bad taste to lug real names into a
personal story of that sort. Come back here,
Poore, and sit down. You must learn to save
yourself all un-necessary trouble.” Poore put
away his book, and returned to his place in
the family circle.</p>

<p>“Care to hear anything more about my
adventures, up there with The Fourth?”
inquired Woodleigh, rising and taking up a
more congenial position, with his back to the
crackling fire. “Because, if you do, there was
another odd thing that happened that evening.
After my heart had been broken, in the way
that I’ve told you, Tileson, the Q.M. of The
Fourth, ran up against me. He noticed that
I wasn’t quite in gear. ‘You’re looking faint,’
says he. ‘Come along with me, and I’ll see
if something can’t be done for you. This ball
business is all childish folly.’ Tileson, you
know, isn’t a dancing man.</p>

<p>“Well, he took me away from the armory,
and over to the club&mdash;you fellows remember
that club they have up there?&mdash;and we
played billiards and other games for a while.
Tileson also fixed me up with restoratives
until I felt quite like myself again; for he
ranks high as a scientific quartermaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Finally we sat down to smoke, and while we
were smoking we got to talking shop.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember just what led up to it,
but we drifted along from one thing to
another until we got into a discussion on athletics.
Well, you know how it goes: Tileson
began to yarn about what he used to do in
that line, when he was younger; and that, of
course, started me into recalling certain feats
of my own long-gone youth; and so we had
it, back and forth, until Tileson ended up
by wanting to make some fool-bet or other.
And right at that point I conceived an idea.</p>

<p>“You see, it was growing late, and I found
that I was becoming sleepier than a stewed
owl. Besides, that club was full of men, and
thick with smoke; and I wanted to get away
from the confounded noise and chatter. I’d
engaged a room at the hotel, and had left my
bag there; for I’d made my plans to stay in
town all night&mdash;but, as I said, I was attacked
by an idea.</p>

<p>“‘Tileson,’ says I, after the idea in all its
beauty had paraded itself before my mind’s
eye, ‘I’m not a betting man. And least of
all will I bet money. Playing for money invariably
leads to hard feelings. His Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, and likewise
I, Woodleigh, Q.M. of The Third, frown
down upon all gambling among officers, both
of us holding that it is detrimental to the best
interests of the service. But I’ll tell you
what I’ll do for your amusement: I’ll make
you a wager of a small dinner. <i>That’s</i> not
gambling, because we both have to eat
dinner, every day in the week, for which
somebody has to pay. Am I correct?’</p>

<p>“Tileson had to admit that a daily dinner
was of the nature of a necessity, and that it
wouldn’t be gambling to risk one. So I proceeded
to spread out the details of my proposition.
‘It is a bright, moon-lighted night,’
says I, after taking a peek at my watch for
certain reasons of my own; ‘there’s no snow
on the ground, and there’s not a breath of
wind: therefore a paper trail would lie beautifully&mdash;which
is something that I personally
can’t do. Why wouldn’t it be an educated
scheme to arrange a hare-and-hounds
chase, as a means of settling this speed question?’</p>

<p>“This seemed to strike Tileson as a grand
thought, and so I went right along with my
remarks. ‘Of course,’ says I, ‘I’ll be handicapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
by not knowing the country, but I’m
reasonably certain that I can start out from
this club with two minutes lee-way, and
lead you a chase for forty-five minutes,
without being caught. I’ll carry a basketful
of paper, and drop a handful of it,
every twenty yards, as long as it lasts. I’ll
also agree not to enter any house or building
during that three-quarters of an hour; my
time shall be entirely devoted to going cross-country.
Moreover, after leaving the club,
and making one turn, I’ll lay my course in a
crow-line&mdash;I mean, as the bee flies&mdash;for a
distance of at least a half-mile, thereby giving
you a chance to run me down by a straightaway
sprint. Now, what do you say?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a go!’ says Tileson, gobbling down
the bait, without a thought for any hook that
might be hidden inside it. ‘Well,’ says I;
‘that’s all I wanted to know. Now I’ll just
slide over to the hotel, and shift out of these
togs. I’m not going to travel cross-country
in a brand-new dress uniform. Can’t afford
it. I shall have to insist on entering for the
event in citizen’s dress. I’ll be back in a
minute, and we’ll draw up final articles.’</p>

<p>“Naturally, Tileson claimed the same privilege,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and made a break for home, to change
his outfit; while I tooled across to the hotel,
to look after a few arrangements of my own.
First, I rushed up to my room, stripped off
my full-dress, and packed it into my travelling
bag, strapping my overcoat on the
outside, with my sword snugly tucked underneath
it. Then I went down to the office,
explained that I had made other plans for
the night, paid my bill, and asked for the
night porter. I bought him outright with a
shining half-dollar, took him into a corner,
and carefully coached him in the part I’d
laid out for him to play in my programme.
Furthermore, I grabbed a sheet of paper, and
wrote out exactly what I wished him to do,
so that there could be no possible slip-up.
And then, having given him my bag and his
written orders, I went back to the club.</p>

<p>“I got there just before Tileson. When
he came in, the fellows sent up a yell that
opened great cracks in the plastering, for he
appeared in the most marvellous get-up that
ever was seen outside of comic opera. I
hadn’t believed it, but it seems that, in his
day, he really used to be something of an
amateur athlete. Well, he’d gone down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
his old-clothes box, and had fished out all
the sporty duds that he could lay hand to:
and there he stood, after he’d thrown off his
ulster, in a pair of spiked running shoes, his
legs bare to the knee, a pair of white flannel
knickerbockers coming next, a striped sweater
a-top of that, and a faded old rowing cap
crowning the whole crazy-quilt combination.
It was very obvious that he hadn’t appeared
in his nondescript regalia for some time previously,
for the billiard-room reeked like an
apothecary shop with the odor of camphor.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he a gaudy object! I had to sit
down to laugh, and it really was quite a time
before I got into shape enough to put in a
protest against his turning up in such light
marching order as that. But it was no use.
He maintained that his rig was citizen’s dress
and nothing else, and the rest of the fellows
backed him up in his claim. So I gracefully
yielded the point. ‘If this isn’t citizen’s
dress, what <i>is</i> it?’ says he. He certainly had
me there.</p>

<p>“By this time the excitement in that club
was quoted at a high figure. It was after
two o’clock in the morning, and the men
were beginning to drop in from the ball in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
squads. At least a dozen of The Fourth’s
officers were there, besides a lot from out of
town. All the odds were on Tileson&mdash;nobody
had the nerve to bet against that fearful
and wonderful rig of his.</p>

<p>“Well, we sent a select committee into the
reading-room, and set them at work tearing
up the old papers on the files for the ‘scent’
that was to be left along my trail. And they
worked with a will, until they’d filled a
waste-basket heaping full. Then we selected
judges, and umpires, and referees, and time-keepers,
until about everybody in the place
had some office or other. And all the while
I kept one eye on the clock that stood in the
corner of the billiard-room. It was an old-fashioned,
tall clock, and I’d noted the fact
that it was eleven minutes slow. This, I’ll
state, made it necessary for me to perform
some wonderful problems in mental arithmetic;
and trying to figure, in the midst of the
row that was going on up there, wasn’t any
intellectual picnic. I managed it, though.</p>

<p>“Now, the billiard-room was at the rear,
and in the third story, of the club-house, and
we’d agreed that the start should be made
from it. This, of course, was because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
didn’t care to have anybody know just what
I was up to during the first two minutes of
the race. I also had stipulated that Tileson
and all hands should stay in that room until
my time-limit had expired. Well, when the
venerable clock alleged that it was two-thirty-nine,
I tucked the waste-paper basket
under my arm, shook hands with Tileson, and
got on my marks at the head of the stairway.
‘Start me at two-forty,’ says I, scooping up a
fistful of paper, and nodding up towards the
clock. ‘<i>’Tention!</i>’ sang out Major Brayton,
whom we’d made head time-keeper. ‘By the
numbers: one&mdash;two&mdash;<i>go</i>!’ And at that I
pitched a bunch of torn paper up into the air,
so that Tileson wouldn’t have any trouble in
finding where my trail began, and then bundled
myself down those stairs like a thousand
of brick.</p>

<p>“But as soon as I landed on the sidewalk,
I took it more easily; for two minutes’ start
was ample for my requirements. I lighted a
cigar, and then headed down the street at an
ordinary gait, conscientiously dropping paper
at every twenty yards. You may bet that I
didn’t run: I wasn’t planning to have any
country policeman scoop <i>me</i> in for a suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
character. Wherein I displayed great
brain-power.</p>

<p>“Now, the club up there, you’ll remember,
is located on the main street of the town.
Very likely you’ll remember also that the
railway station lies only about a hundred
yards down the street from the club-house.
Furthermore, the tracks of the railway run
across that street at grade, in the comfortably
reckless way that they have in towns of that
size. Well, now you have the whole situation,
and you can see, of course, what my
plan of campaign was like.</p>

<p>“I’d recalled the fact, while I was talking
with Tileson, that the down mail-train from
Canada was due to strike the town at two-forty-eight,
and was scheduled to continue
its run to the eastward at two-fifty-three. I
happened to know, too, that it seldom picked
up any passengers at that hour of the night:
that, in fact, it stopped mainly for the purpose
of watering the engine and juggling
mail-bags. So I felt fairly confident that nobody
would suspect me of having any designs
on <i>that</i> particular method of performing a
cross-country run. And events proved that
I was right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
“Well, after I’d cleared the club, I strolled
down the street and took up my position
alongside the track, just as the locomotive
gave a warning snort and came slowly pulling
out from the station. I looked at my watch.
It showed two-fifty-three, to a second. I
turned and glanced towards the club, and saw
a white figure come shooting out into the
moonlight, followed by a running accompaniment
of darker shapes. And then, as the
engine went puffing past, I faced towards the
train.</p>

<p>“It gathered headway slowly, and the first
cars seemed to crawl by me. But by the
time the baggage-car, mail-car, and a pair
of ordinary coaches had gone lumbering
past, the whole outfit was making pretty fair
speed; and when I grabbed the handrail of the
Pullman which came along as rear guard to
the whole procession, I had to hop like a
monkey with Saint Vitus’ dance. I got
aboard all right, though, and brought my
paper-basket with me, without spilling more
than a reasonable amount of its contents.
And then I looked back, and saw things happening.</p>

<p>“Now, while I was standing by the track,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
waiting for the Pullman to get within boarding
distance, I’d heard, above the roar of the
train, a perfect pandemonium of other sounds.
But I hadn’t had the nerve to look behind
me, because I knew that I’d have to make
pretty close connections with my handrail,
when it came along. I was painfully aware
that I should have a narrow squeak in getting
away; for the distance from the club was
so short that Tileson stood a very brilliant
show of covering it before the train could
gather headway enough to save me from
being run down. And, if it hadn’t been for
a providential miracle, I’m inclined to think
that I should have had to pay for that dinner,
after all. But the miracle got there just in
the nick of time.</p>

<p>“It seems that it’s the custom of the one
policeman on night duty in that town to go
to the station to meet all trains, whereby he
keeps himself awake and exercises a sort of
general supervision over the in-comings and
out-goings of the populace. Well, as the
train left the station, the policeman sauntered
out upon the main street, just in time
to see coming tearing towards him a wild man
in indecent garments, followed by a mob of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
panting pursuers. Naturally enough he saw
before him the chance of a lifetime; and so he
pulled himself into shape, tackled Tileson,
and down they went in a wild snarl of arms
and legs and bad language. And that’s what
I saw as I stood there on the rear platform;
for it was a bright, moonlight night, and
everything was as plain as print. The show
didn’t last long for me, though, because the
train was humming along on a straight
stretch of track, and in a little while the
smoke and dust streamed out in its wake, like
a curtain falling on the last act of a tragedy.
Did I laugh? <i>Did</i> I? I did&mdash;until I came
perilously near rolling off the car! I kept my
wits about me, though, and religiously dealt
out torn paper, every twenty yards, until it
was all gone. I didn’t forget that I’d made
a solemn agreement to leave behind me a
plain and continuous trail.</p>

<p>“At the rate at which we were spinning
along it didn’t take a great while to exhaust
my supply of ‘scent.’ When the last of it
was gone, I kicked the basket overboard, and
went inside the car. And there I found my
luggage waiting me, and a berth all engaged;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
for my man from the hotel had followed his
orders to the letter.</p>

<p>“Now, I’d like to ask you if that wasn’t
quite an event in amateur athletics? I hold
that the cross-country championship belongs
to The Third; and I also claim that I scored
on Tileson and his suit of many colors.” On
which points the sentiment of the meeting
seemed to be with Woodleigh.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards one of us happened
to run across Whateley. “That man
Woodleigh, of yours, is a corker!” said he.
“After I left the ball, the other night, I
went up to that club where The Fourth’s fellows
hang out. Got there just after Woodleigh
had gone sailing off in a chariot of fire,
like old what’s-his-name. Well, it was worth
a four-cornered gold brick to hear ’em rubbing
it into Tileson! Did you know he came
within an inch of being pulled in for assaulting
a constable? Oh, he’ll never hear the
last of it! I’d like to go you five that he sends
in his papers before next camp. Old Woodleigh
didn’t cut a very wide swath at the
dance, though. Did he tell you about it?
He was paired off with a little, stumpy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
freckle-faced girl, and had to tramp nine laps
’round the hall with her in the ‘Grand March,’
so called. Perhaps he wasn’t the picture of
misery! He and Tileson escaped, right after
the march; sneaked for the club before the
music struck up for the first waltz. Really,
you fellows ought to send somebody else
besides Woodleigh to represent you on occasions
of that sort. He doesn’t do his
duty.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>THE KERWICK CUP.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Elsewhere</span> in the annals of The
Third it has been stated&mdash;and the
statement proven&mdash;that Major Pollard
can shoot. Here it will be shown that
he can shoot not only well, but also most
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>It was the night before Christmas. Pollard
was walking slowly along the street, on his
way home from the theater. He felt at peace
with himself and with all the rest of the
world; for that afternoon, by a despairing
and truly heroic effort, he had managed to
dispatch a half-dozen neat parcels conveying
to the immediate members of his family the
greetings appropriate to the season. And
this was an achievement of no small magnitude;
for everybody knows how difficult it is
to pick out various sorts of gifts for various
sorts of people, especially when certain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
those people are women, and the giver of the
gifts has the misfortune to be a man&mdash;and
a single one. Which will explain, it may
be, why so many men get themselves married,
and then straightway delegate to their
wives full authority in the matter of selecting
presents.</p>

<p>The air was keen. A light, powdery snow
came lazily drifting down, only to find its
whiteness quickly lost upon the much traveled
pavement. A red-cheeked newsboy,
whining the old, old story about being
“stuck,” placed himself in Pollard’s path;
and the major, in the true spirit of Christmastide,
was exploring his pocket in search of
the necessary bit of silver&mdash;when, full in the
glare of an electric lamp, there came into
sight a figure that somehow seemed familiar.</p>

<p>Stopping short in his hunt for a dime, Pollard
stared hard at the approaching form; and
then, tossing to the expectant urchin the first
coin upon which his fingers chanced to close,
he started in pursuit of his man, who already
had passed him, and was going at a rate of
speed that made it probable that in another
minute he would be lost to view in the midst
of the theater crowd upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
A few rapid strides brought the major to
his side, and a last, quick glance satisfied him
that he had not been mistaken. “Hello,
Kerwick,” said he, laying his hand upon the
shoulder of the other. “Thought I couldn’t
be wrong. Well, well! I’m more than glad
to see you back again.”</p>

<p>At the sound of Pollard’s voice the man
stopped and shrank away. He had been
walking rapidly along, with head lowered and
eyes fixed upon the ground, as if to avoid any
chance recognition. He wore no overcoat,
and the collar of his shiny, black cutaway
was turned up to protect his throat from the
biting night air. Taken as a whole, he was
not a cheerful object to contemplate.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s you, Pollard, is it?” he said, with
a side glance at the major. “How are you?
I’m just back from the West today. Nasty
night, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Pollard, noting that his
ill-conditioned friend could with difficulty
keep from shivering; “too nasty for making
visits on the curbstone. I’m just going to
raid some place for oysters and other hot
things. You’ll join me, Captain?”</p>

<p>At the sound of this title the other drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
himself up a bit; but in an instant he fell
back a pace, flushing painfully. “Join
you?” he said bitterly, thrusting his benumbed
hands deeply into his trousers’ pockets;
“join <i>you</i>! Good God, Pollard, look at
me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>am</i> looking at you,” said the
major, allowing his gaze to travel slowly up
and down the shrinking figure before him.
“You certainly look terribly seedy, and not
much like the Captain Kerwick under whom
I used to serve. But if that’s any reason for
your refusing to sit down to half-a-dozen
Blue-Points with me, why, I simply fail to see
it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not do it,” said the other doggedly.
“No, Pollard, I’ll not do it. I’m out of your
world, and you’re out of mine. That’s the
long and short of it. Possibly you noticed
that I didn’t say I was glad to see you?
Well, I’m not. I’m confoundedly sorry I set
eyes on you; or, rather, that you set eyes on
me. Will you let me go <i>now</i>? Good
night.”</p>

<p>Without a word in reply to this outbreak,
Pollard slipped an arm under that of his
friend, and used the other to aid his voice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
attracting the attention of a passing cab.
When the vehicle pulled up beside the curbing,
he wrenched open the door, good-naturedly
pushed in his prisoner, and followed,
after having given to the driver the address
of his cosey bachelor rooms in an up-town
hotel.</p>

<p>“My dear man,” said he, drawing up the
heavy robe and carefully tucking it around
his thinly clad companion, “it’s useless for
you to protest. There’s been a change since
you were lord high autocrat of ‘M’ Company.
I’ve climbed up from lieutenant to captain,
and then from captain to major; so you
can see the utter folly of trying to dispute
my commands. You’ll have to submit, Kerwick,
and you’ll do well to submit gracefully.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Pollard, twenty minutes
later, after he had settled his captive in a big
arm-chair before the glowing coal fire in his
rooms, “now we’ll consider the question of
supper, first. Other matters may wait their
turn. You may bring up,” to the neatly
uniformed colored boy who had appeared in
answer to his vigorous assault upon the electric
bell, “two half-dozens of oysters on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
shell, and a small tenderloin steak, fairly well-done,
and a bottle of&mdash;” He gave a side
glance at the man seated before his fire.
“And a pot of coffee,” he amended.</p>

<p>“That last was well thought of,” said Kerwick,
as the bell boy left the room. “You’re
still observant, I see. Well, you’ve guessed
it; the bottle has held altogether too prominent
a place in my recent history.”</p>

<p>The ruins of the supper had been cleared
away. Kerwick was again installed before
the fire, with a cigar. Pollard lighted his old
black briar, pulled a chair towards the hearth,
and said, as he seated himself, “We’re not to
have a green Yuletide, this year, after all.
It’s snowing in earnest now.”</p>

<p>“H’m! tomorrow’s Christmas,” murmured
Kerwick, with something like a sigh. “So
it is. I hadn’t thought much about it. Well,
Pollard, you haven’t asked me yet&mdash;but I
suppose you’re waiting for me to give an
account of myself.”</p>

<p>The major nodded, and smoked on in
silence while his friend told the story of the
past few years: How he had broken away
from all his early associations in order to
grasp at what had seemed a chance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
making rapid fortune in the West; how reverses
had come quickly, one upon another,
until&mdash;baffled and beaten at every point&mdash;he
had yielded under the repeated blows, and
finally had staggered and gone down beneath
the weight of discouragement.</p>

<p>“And here I am, back again,” Kerwick
wound up, flinging into the fire his half finished
cigar, as if its flavor brought to him
some of the bitterness of recent disappointment;
“here I am, at forty-five, in what
should be the prime of my life&mdash;homeless,
hopeless, penniless, and out of the game.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Pollard, as the other finished.
“Now, old man, see here: you’re not to
throw away my cigars in the same careless
way in which you’ve thrown away your
chances. They’re too choice, if I do say it,
to be handled disrespectfully. Take another,
and <i>smoke</i> it.” He pushed the box across
the table towards Kerwick. “These weeds
were made to be burned&mdash;but not in open
grates.”</p>

<p>Kerwick laughed shortly, picked a fresh
cigar from the box, and lighted it. “You’ll
have to pardon me,” said he. “That was
temporary insanity. I haven’t smoked a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
decent cigar, before these, in nobody knows
how many months.”</p>

<p>“Now, as for your croaking,” resumed
Pollard, giving emphasis to his remarks by an
occasional thump of his heavy fist upon the
arm of his chair; “I’m going to make the
only comment that seems to fit the case.
Which is, ‘<i>Stuff!</i>’ For you’re playing now
with nothing to lose and everything to win.
Why, Kerwick, you <i>must</i> see it! Nothing
from nothing leaves nothing; but nothing
plus something may amount to almost anything.
Confound you, old man! I used to
look up to you as the embodiment of grit and
push&mdash;and I’ll not let you tumble down in
my estimation, nor in your own.”</p>

<p>“Too late, Polly,” answered Kerwick in a
low tone, half unconsciously letting fall a
nickname of the old days. “You mean well,
but it’s too late&mdash;it’s too late now.”</p>

<p>“Blessed if it isn’t!” exclaimed the major,
putting upon the words of the other a construction
of his own. “It’s quarter to twelve,
and high old time for us to be sliding into
bed. There’s a good day’s work cut out for
both of us tomorrow. I dare say you haven’t
forgotten the bit of silverware that used to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
by the name of ‘The Kerwick Cup’? Well,
tomorrow we shoot for it.”</p>

<p>Now, it might be well to mention that Kerwick,
in the prosperous days when he was
captain of “M” Company, was a rifleman of
great enthusiasm, and of no small skill. And
when, on leaving for the West, he resigned
his commission, he gave to his old command,
as memorials of his interest in the most manly
of all sports, two trophies&mdash;The Kerwick
Cup, and The Kerwick Medal. These were
to be shot for in annual competition: the
medal, by the enlisted men; the cup, by the
active and past officers of the company. And
for a number of years it had been the custom
to shoot both these matches on the forenoon
of Christmas day.</p>

<p>“Are those old things still in existence?”
asked the captain, with a slight show of interest.
“Really! I’d half forgotten them. But
then,” wearily, “I’ve forgotten most of the
things in which I ever found any pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Bah! you couldn’t forget the fun we’ve
had together; no, not for the life of you,”
Pollard burst out impatiently. “Well, the
old cup’s still waiting to be won; and so’s
the medal. Sergeant Harvey&mdash;he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
corporal in your day, wasn’t he?&mdash;won the
medal three times straight, which nearly gave
it to him for keeps. But he’s out of the service
now. The cup? Oh, I’m bidding high
myself for the cup. My name’s been engraved
on it for three years, hand-running,
and tomorrow may or may not send it my way
for the fourth and final holding.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I remember now,” said Kerwick;
“both the old things had to be won four times
consecutively in order to pass the title. I
hope you’ll pull out all right, Pollard; I’d be
glad to know that the mug was decorating
your mantel. I’ll look for your score in the
papers. Well, as you say, it’s growing late.
You’ve given me a very pleasant evening, and
I’d like to tell you how it has brought back
old times, being up here with you in this
way&mdash;but perhaps I needn’t. Good night.”
And with this he rose, buttoned his thin black
coat closely about him, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>In an instant Pollard was upon his feet.
“What the deuce are you thinking of doing?”
he demanded, placing himself by a sudden
movement between Kerwick and the door.
“Going to leave me, eh? Not much! You’re
my prisoner, sir; sit down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
For a minute the captain faced Pollard,
with an appealing look upon his face; but he
ended by yielding to the stronger will, and
obediently dropped back into his chair. The
major came over to the fireplace, and took up
his position upon the hearthrug, with his back
to the fire. His teeth were firmly set upon
the amber mouthpiece of his pipe, and as he
spoke he punctuated his sentences with an
occasional short puff of smoke. “Now pay
attention to what I’m saying to you,” he
began, looking down kindly upon the man
before him, “because it has ‘Official’ stamped
all over it, and it’s not to be disputed about,
nor argued over.”</p>

<p>“Six years ago,” said Pollard, letting himself
drop back until his broad shoulders rested
comfortably against the high mantel-shelf,
“you and I were good friends. As I recall
it, we used to find life rather a pleasant sort
of thing. But, not content with leaving well
enough alone, you had to send yourself chasing
away after the pot of gold at the foot of
the western rainbow. Well, luck didn’t run
your way: either you didn’t hold openers, or
else the pot was buried too deeply to be
easily got at&mdash;and here you are, back again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
after having made a most praiseworthy attempt
at going to the devil.”</p>

<p>“Is this a sermon?” asked Kerwick, at this
point in Pollard’s discourse.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said the major earnestly; “at
least, it’s not meant for one. But what I’m
getting at is this: you’ve got to borrow a
leaf from the politician’s book, and ‘put yourself
into the hands of your friends.’ Now,
we can’t map out a whole career for you at a
single sitting; so we’ll simply settle the programme
for the next forty-eight hours, and
call it a night’s work at that.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Kerwick dryly. “To tell
the truth, I <i>don’t</i> feel quite up to arranging
my future at the present moment.”</p>

<p>“No?” said Pollard. “Neither do I. But
you may consider this much of it as having
been already arranged: tomorrow we go out
with the company, shoot in the cup match&mdash;you
may win your own mug, if you’re lucky
enough&mdash;then we come back to town, dine
together, and wind up the day with an old-fashioned
evening of yarning and smoking,
up here in these rooms; day after tomorrow,
we consider what’s to be done with you; after
that, we begin to do it. See?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
“I wish I could, Polly,” began Kerwick,
“but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, about clothes and things,” broke in
the major; “I can fit you out to a button.
We go out in fatigue, you know, tomorrow:
well, when I got my last promotion, I was
so tickled over it that I treated myself to a
whole new outfit, so I’ve my captain’s uniform
still on hand, and it’ll fit you like wall
paper unless you’ve changed several sizes
since last we ran together.”</p>

<p>The clock upon the mantel began to strike.
From without, hushed and mellowed by the
thickly falling snow, came the sound of the
chimes in old St. Luke’s.</p>

<p>“Hello! it’s morning,” said Pollard, as the
clock’s deep-toned gong told off the last stroke
of midnight. “Merry Christmas, Kerwick!
<i>Merry Christmas, old man!</i> Got ahead of you
that time, didn’t I? And now we must crawl
under the blankets, for in ten hours from now
we’ll be bullseye chasing.”</p>

<p>Kerwick slowly rose from his chair. He
placed both hands on Pollard’s shoulders,
looked him full in the face, and said, “God
bless you, Polly!” And then, the least bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
huskily, he added, “Perhaps you’re right,
after all. Perhaps it’s <i>not</i> too late.”</p>

<p>Pollard saw his old commander safely
stowed away in the little box of a room that
he was pleased to call his guest chamber, and
then went about his preparations for the coming
match. First, he put in order his rifle,
and filled his thimble belt with half a hundred
cartridges of his own careful loading. Then,
after laying out his own uniform, he hunted
through closet and wardrobe until he had
got together a captain’s full outfit, which he
placed upon a chair, just outside the door of
Kerwick’s room.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood there listening.
From within came the sound of deep, regular
breathing. He softly turned the knob,
and stepped into the room. Kerwick lay
sound asleep, with his face turned towards
the wall. Feeling like a full-fledged thief,
Pollard laid hands upon the waistcoat which
hung at the head of the bed, and then stealthily
crept out of the room.</p>

<p>There was no watch in the waistcoat.
Pollard opened a drawer of his desk, took
out a plain silver timepiece&mdash;a relic of his
school days&mdash;wound and set it, and slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
it into its proper pocket. He explored the
other pockets. In one he found a ragged two
dollar bill; in another, a stub of pencil and a
card of common matches. That was all.</p>

<p>Tossing the vulgar brimstone matches into
the fire, he went again to his desk and rummaged
about until he found a silver match
box&mdash;one of many that had come to him on
birthdays and other times of the sort&mdash;which
he filled with parlor matches and
placed in the lower, left-hand pocket. Then
he drew out a roll of bills, picked out three
crisp fives, folded them up, once lengthwise
and once across, with Kerwick’s poor, tattered
banknote, and tucked the money snugly into
the lower, right-hand pocket. And then he
stole back into the captain’s room, and hung
the garment in the place in which he had
found it.</p>

<p>“Poor devil! He’s utterly done up,” he
said to himself, as he left the room, after a
last glance at his sleeping guest. “And no
wonder! Well, there’s another Santa Claus
tradition gone wrong! I haven’t put anything
into the old chap’s socks. Never mind. The
chances are that they’re too full of holes to
make the filling of ’em a possibility.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
He went over to the mantel, filled a leather
cigar case with <i>Perfectos</i>, and stowed it away
in the inner pocket of the fatigue jacket which
lay ready for Kerwick to don in the morning.
This done, he stood thinking for a moment
before the fire, and then, beginning rapidly
to throw off his clothes, he muttered, “Yes,
that will work. It’s <i>sure</i> to!” With which
truly oracular remark he started off to bed.</p>

<p>Christmas day came in under a clear sky.
Pollard rose at an early hour, went to the
window for a hasty glance at the snowy world
outside, and then rapped noisily at his friend’s
door, singing out cheerily, “Hi! Kerwick.
Time you were getting up.” And to hasten
matters, he whistled the bars of <i>Reveille</i>, the
lively call which, many a time, had brought
them tumbling out from their blankets when
under canvas with the Old Regiment.</p>

<p>Kerwick’s night of untroubled sleep had
worked wonders. After a dip into the bath,
and ten minutes’ careful work with the
razor, he looked another man. And when at
last, arrayed in captain’s uniform, he had
inspected himself in Pollard’s mirror, he faced
about, threw back his shoulders, and said
with a healthy ring in his voice, “Polly, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
son, I’ve been pretty far down, but I’ll live up
to my old rank again&mdash;if only for today.”</p>

<p>“Did anybody ever see such a fit?” asked
Pollard, gazing admiringly at the natty appearance
of his friend. “Talk about being
melted and poured into clothes! Why, that
blouse looks as if it had been frescoed on
you.”</p>

<p>Kerwick passed his hand over the breast of
the snugly clinging blouse, and became
aware, in doing it, that something lay hidden
beneath its surface. Unbuttoning it, he drew
out the cigar case. “Ah, that was thoughtful
of you,” said he. “Thank you, Polly.”</p>

<p>Struck by a sudden thought, he ran his
fingers into the pocket where the lone bill
had been. The modest wad of money came
into view. He colored slightly, and then
tried a second pocket, whereby he discovered
the little silver watch, which looked him
boldly in the face, and promptly ticked out
its holiday greeting. In its turn, too, the
match box came to light. And all the while
Pollard stood by, surveying the proceedings
with a grin of satisfied approval.</p>

<p>“The match box and the matches in it,”
explained the major, “are from Santa Claus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
The same applies to the cigar case and its
contents. The watch and those few bills are
a loan from me; you’ll return ’em when it’s
most convenient. And now we must be
moving.”</p>

<p>The two ex-captains breakfasted together,
and then hastened down to the station for the
early morning train. With a little group of
other past officers they were standing upon
the platform, when the shrill squeak of a fife
and the lively rattle of a drum came clearly
on the crisp December air, to warn them that
the boys were drawing near. And in a
moment, to the tune of <i>The Bold MacIntyre</i>,
the company came swinging in through the
wide doorway and down the long platform,
making the vaulted roof of the trainhouse
resound with the steady tramp, tramp, tramp
of the marching column.</p>

<p>Three officers, white-gloved and trim; fifty
men, muffled in the blue great-coats of the
service; fifty rifles sloping at the trail; belts
black and glossy, buttons and brasses glittering
like polished mirrors&mdash;it all went to
make as bright a picture of the pomp and
circumstance of volunteering as one could
wish to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
The train slowly pulled out from the long
station, bearing the jolly little army towards
its peaceful battle ground. Pollard settled
Kerwick safely at the forward end of the car,
with Colonel Elliott, and then industriously
began the final development of the grand
idea which had taken shape in his brain the
night before. One after another he button-holed
the dozen or so officers in the car,
attacking each one somewhat after this
fashion:</p>

<p>“Here’s old Kerwick back again. Seems
good to see him, doesn’t it? Blamed good
fellow, if ever there was one! Well, he’s
been having a horrible run of luck lately. I
happen to know that he’s hard pushed, and
is worrying over it. But he’s clear sand, grit
’way through to the vertebræ&mdash;and none of
us ever will find out from <i>him</i> how he’s been
getting it in the neck. Now, I want to fix
up a sort of benefit for him. You’ll help me
out in it? Of course; knew you would.
But we can’t chip in to <i>give</i> him anything.
He’s too infernally proud: wouldn’t have it,
you know.</p>

<p>“Here’s what I’d propose: we’ll make up
a sweepstake in the cup match, throw in five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
dollars apiece, and then let Kerwick win
the whole business. None of us will be
killed by dropping a fiver, but the aggregate
pot will give the old chap quite a lift. He
used to shoot like a demon once. Don’t
know if he can now&mdash;but we can make sure
that we shoot worse than he does, anyway.
We’ll have to do all this quietly, on account
of the men; ’twouldn’t do to have ’em get
the idea that we’re gambling. Grand strategy
on a small scale, isn’t it?” And with this,
Pollard would release that particular victim,
and start off in search of yet another recruit
for his enterprise.</p>

<p>The annual shoot of “M” Company certainly
was a notable success. The Kerwick
Medal was won on the phenomenal score of
thirty-three points, in seven shots; and no
less than sixteen of the fifty men competing
for it managed to roll up an average of
centers, or better. But when it came to the
struggle for the Kerwick <i>Cup</i>&mdash;well, that
was a different matter!</p>

<p>Pollard quietly had collected the entries
for the sweepstake, and had turned over the
money to Colonel Elliott, who&mdash;not being a
past officer of the company&mdash;could not shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
for the cup. He had some difficulty in getting
Kerwick into the match, but finally
succeeded in persuading him that it would
look odd if he, with his past reputation as
a rifle sharp, should persist in staying out.
There were twelve competitors in all, and
consequently the colonel found himself the
custodian of sixty dollars’ worth of the
Government’s paper.</p>

<p>The match began. Colonel Hamilton, of
the retired list, and Captain Bromstead, of
the active company, made the first pair.
Bromstead has rather educated ideas about
the handling of a rifle, and Colonel Hamilton
seldom scatters much lead outside the four
ring; but in this particular match the shooting
of both was something fearful to behold
and wonderful to reflect upon. For the captain’s
seven shots netted just twenty-one
points, while Hamilton, after piling up an
even twenty, fell back from the firing point in
well feigned disgust.</p>

<p>And so it went, as pair after pair took their
turn at the targets, until&mdash;amid a storm of
good-natured chaffing&mdash;all except Kerwick
and Pollard had fired. Up to this point, the
top score was twenty-five. It had been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
by little Poore, junior lieutenant of the company,
who afterwards apologized to Pollard
for doing such brilliant work, explaining that,
by way of experiment, he had closed both
eyes when firing his last shot, by which means&mdash;to
his utter astonishment and no small
chagrin&mdash;he had plumped his bullet dead
into the center of the bullseye.</p>

<p>“Major Pollard and Captain Kerwick!”
called the scorer. Kerwick stepped quickly
to his place, and the major slowly followed.</p>

<p>“After you, Pollard,” said Kerwick, with
a nod towards the targets, to signify that the
major should lead off.</p>

<p>“No, no, Captain,” said Pollard; “after
you. I’m defending the cup, you know, and
it’s my privilege to see what I must shoot
against.”</p>

<p>Kerwick tested the pull of his piece, looked
keenly at the sights, gave just the slightest
touch to the wind-gauge, slipped in a cartridge,
and then leveled the long barrel upon
the target. For three seconds he stood
motionless, and then he fired. It was a
bullseye. The group behind him sent up a
murmur of applause, which was promptly
checked by Colonel Elliott. Pollard threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
his piece easily to his shoulder, aimed quickly
fired, and brought up a bullseye in his turn.</p>

<p>Kerwick’s second shot was a close four;
Pollard’s, another bullseye. On the third
attempt, Kerwick again found the black,
while the major’s shot was a very chilly
center. After the sixth round had been
completed, the captain stepped back and
glanced at the scorer’s blackboard. The
story then read:</p>

<table summary="scores">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Captain Kerwick</i></td>
    <td class="tdl">5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Major Pollard</i></td>
    <td class="tdl">5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>He went back to his place, and passed his
hand across his eyes, as if to drive away the
dazzling glare of the sun upon the snow.
Barring a bright red spot on either cheek,
his face was ashen pale. Those who were
watching him closely noticed that his knees
were slightly trembling.</p>

<p>Among the officers in rear of the firing
point there was suppressed excitement.
Little Poore drew Bromstead aside, and in
a whisper confided to him his opinion that
Pollard was a combination of pirate, bunco-steerer,
and all-’round brute. He also hinted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
at the advisability of jamming a handful of
snow down the back of Pollard’s neck, in
order to disarrange his nervous system.
Colonel Elliott, with one hand deep in his
trousers’ pocket, savagely clutching the roll
of bills confided to his keeping, stood blackly
scowling at Pollard, and endeavoring to catch
his eye. But the major calmly went on with
the operation of blowing through the barrel of
his rifle, and never once turned to see what
might be going on behind him.</p>

<p>Kerwick raised his rifle, and aimed. But
the barrel perceptibly wavered, and after an
instant of hesitation he lowered the piece.
He drew a long breath, aimed again, and
then&mdash;<i>then</i>, with a convulsive jerk, he pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>At the crack of the rifle a little spray of
glittering snow spurted up into the sunlight,
just beyond the right edge of the target.
The strain had been too heavy. Kerwick’s
last and all important shot had gone wide!
A small, red flag was raised before the face of
the target. Slowly, mockingly it was waved
to and fro. “Miss,” said the scorer softly, as
he chalked down the fatal zero.</p>

<p>Pollard glanced quickly at the unlucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
captain, and then settled into position for
firing. Kerwick laughed weakly, and faced
about, to walk away. But suddenly he
stopped, turned from the sympathizing group
behind the firing point, and fixed his gaze
upon the targets; for he had become aware
that the muscles around his mouth were
twitching, and that&mdash;because of the glaring
snow, perhaps&mdash;his eyes were being blinded
by a hot gush of tears.</p>

<p>There came a sharp report. Pollard’s last
bullet was speeding its way across the two
hundred yards of snow. And in a moment
the white disk crept into sight&mdash;<i>but not on
Pollard’s target</i>! Bullseye though the shot
was, it could be scored only as a miss.</p>

<p>“Da’&mdash;thunderation!” yelled Pollard,
giving an exhibition of realistic acting sufficiently
fine to have made Salvini faint dead
away, could he have seen it. “Oh, glory!
I’m on the wrong target&mdash;and there goes
the blooming old cup! Kerwick’s score outranks.
What luck! Oh, what <i>infernal</i>
luck!”</p>

<p>There was a roar from the crowd. The
knot of excited watchers did not need to be
reminded of the rule that, in the case of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
absolute tie, the winning score is the one in
which the ranking shots lie nearest towards
the end. Half the officers sought relief for
their feelings by thumping Kerwick upon the
back. The other half, among whom little
Poore was more than conspicuous, piled themselves
upon Pollard. And it was a long time
before anybody heard Kerwick protesting
that, whatever else he might have won, the
cup was Pollard’s, because of a clause in
the half-forgotten deed of gift by which
the donor was barred from winning his own
trophy.</p>

<p>“Why did I do it?” said Pollard later,
when reproached for the brilliancy of his
shooting in the earlier part of his score.
“Well, you see, I just had to. Old Kerwick
wouldn’t have half enjoyed his winning if he
hadn’t been pushed for the place. Besides,
if I’d shot much worse, that child Poore
would have gobbled the cup, which never
would have done. For I wanted that myself.
But I felt like a beast, just the same, when
poor old Kerwick broke down, after he’d
started a lead mine in the snow with that
last bullet of his.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>OFFICIALLY REPORTED.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">This</span> tale already has been in print.
Browning, of the <i>Herald</i>, Rodman, of
the <i>Globe</i>, and Major Larry, of The
Third, were jointly responsible for its first
appearance. But inasmuch as it was printed
in the papers, and since things that see the
light in that way speedily are forgotten&mdash;unless,
to the confusion of those who first
perpetrated them, they happen to be available
for resurrection in deadly parallel
columns&mdash;it has seemed good to rescue it
from the oblivion of last year’s dusty files.</p>

<p>Major Larry, it will be remembered, is the
young gentleman whom Captain Tom Stearns,
of <i>A</i> Company, once upon a time appointed
“Company Kid” of his command. How
Larry afterwards demonstrated the wisdom
of the captain’s selection, and how he won
promotion to the position for which his soul
yearned&mdash;the post of honor at the front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the big bass-drum&mdash;already has been told.
In fact, since Major Larry numbers his
friends and acquaintances by the hundred,
he needs no farther introduction.</p>

<p>It was two weeks after the regimental
autumn manœuvres, and twenty minutes
after <i>recall</i> had sounded on a certain drill
night. The adjutant threaded his way along
the swarming corridors of the big armory,
climbed a flight of oaken stairs, and
turned in at the doorway of <i>A’s</i> quarters.
In the captain’s room he found Major Larry,
industriously plying a whisk broom upon a
braided fatigue-jacket.</p>

<p>“Where’s Stearns?” demanded the adjutant,
halting upon the threshold.</p>

<p>Larry promptly brought his heels together,
tucked the jacket under his left arm, and
smartly raised his right hand, brush and all,
to his forehead. “Cap’n Stearns?” said he.
“He’s flew.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the adjutant. “The
captain’s <i>flew</i>, eh? And his report’s ten days
over-due!”</p>

<p>“W’at’s de report dat’s missin’?” anxiously
inquired Larry.</p>

<p>The adjutant turned and looked down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
upon his questioner. “Oh, it’s not a
matter of life-and-death importance,” said
he; “only Captain Stearns ought to have
sent in a written account of his company’s
part in the manœuvres, and I should have
had it long ago.”</p>

<p>“I was wid <i>A</i>,” said the boy. “W’at’s de
matter wid <i>me</i> reportin’?”</p>

<p>The adjutant paused and considered.
Major Larry is noted for keen observation
of men and things, and his command of
words, such as they are, is a source of joy to
all at headquarters. The adjutant decided
accordingly. “What’s the matter indeed!”
said he, starting towards the colonel’s room.
“Come along with me, Major. We’ll make
this report a verbal one.”</p>

<p>In the colonel’s private office a coal fire
was glowing in the open grate. Before it
sat the chief, with Browning and Rodman,
the two “war correspondents,” who had
dropped in to see if anything of interest in
regimental matters was about to happen.
Everybody in the service knows Browning
and Rodman, and knows them, moreover,
collectively; because, as a rule, where one of
them is found, there also is to be found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
other. What would the annual tour of camp
duty be without their presence? And how,
but for them, would the great and careless
Public be kept from forgetting the very existence
of that modest institution, the volunteer
service?</p>

<p>“Did you get that report?” asked the
colonel, looking up as the adjutant and
Major Larry entered.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the adjutant. “Captain
Stearns is compelled to ask for an extension
of time. But I’ve done the next best thing.
Here’s Major Larry Callahan, the captain’s
chief of staff, who has kindly volunteered to
report in person on the operations of <i>A</i>
Company.”</p>

<p>At the adjutant’s opening words the colonel
frowned, but, as he finished, the frown
gave way to a very broad smile. Larry
neither frowned nor smiled, but stood attention,
awaiting orders. He was very much
in earnest, feeling that his patron, the delinquent
captain, was in a bad box, from which
it was his duty to extricate him.</p>

<p>Rodman leaned over towards his fellow
journalist, and said something in a low
tone, at the same time placing a coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
upon his knee, concealed by his outspread
hand.</p>

<p>“Heads,” said Browning, nodding assent
to the proposition that had been made.</p>

<p>“Guess again!” said Rodman, uncovering
the silver piece; “it’s tails. This is <i>my</i>
story.” And he quietly drew a note-book
from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the colonel, turning towards
Larry.</p>

<p>“It’s be’n dis way wid de cap’n,” said the
boy; “he isn’t had much time since de battle,
an’ to-night he was called out o’ town sudden.
I jus’ got a cab for’m to hustle to de
ten-t’irty express. But I c’n report w’at A
done, if youse want it right off, jus’ as well’s
de cap’n could. ’Cause I was dere, see?
An’ I didn’t have nuttin’ on me mind ’ceptin’
to catch on to w’at was happenin’. It was
diffrunt wid de cap’n: he was busy wid
bot’ han’s, tryin’ to keep de boys from blowin’
de heads off’n ’emselves.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the colonel. “But you
should have been with the drum corps,
Larry. What brought you in with <i>A</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Major Larry in some confusion,
“t’ings was terruble slow in de drummin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
department. We wasn’t in de fight,
you know, sir, an’ I didn’t feel like I was
learnin’ nuttin’ ’bout war, a-sittin’ down in
de shade an’ listenin’ to de fellies tell yarns
dat was grey headed w’en Noah was yachtin’
in de ark. So w’en de drum major started
in to get off de rattiest ches’nut o’ de season,
I oozed out o’ sight behin’ a big tree, an’
from dat I skinned across to anodder one, an’
den I sneaked it, t’rough de brush an’ over
de fields, to where <i>A</i> was posted.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” muttered the colonel, frowning
darkly. “How long is it, Adjutant, since
we’ve had to have a regimental court-martial?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to do nuttin’ wrong, sir!”
said Larry hastily. “I wasn’t no use where
I was, an’ I t’ought p’raps I c’d be some
help to de cap’n if I happened over dat way.
I didn’t t’ink de drum major needed me any
longer, sir. An’ he didn’t say I couldn’t go.
Hones’!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can thank your lucky stars
that I didn’t catch you away from your post,”
said the colonel grimly. “This time I’ll
overlook the breach of discipline on account
of your extreme youth, but you’ll do well to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
be careful in the future. And now go on
with your report.”</p>

<p>The adjutant quietly slipped out of the
room, going in the direction of the staff
office. He was back again in an instant,
and soon after he had seated himself,
Langforth, the paymaster, and Woodleigh,
Q.M., casually put in an appearance and
took possession of a couple of chairs near the
door.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’ know,” said Larry hesitatingly,
in response to the colonel’s command, “jus’
exackly how to begin. I was dere, for a fac’,
an’ seen de whole scrap&mdash;but I aint used to
makin’ reports.”</p>

<p>“You’ll begin,” said the colonel, slowly and
impressively, “by describing the <i>terrain</i>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>W’at’s</i> dat?” interrupted Larry most respectfully.</p>

<p>“It means the lay of the land,” said the
colonel. “You’ll describe to us the lay of
the land. Then you’ll state the disposition
of the troops engaged. And then you’ll tell
what those troops did, paying particular attention
to the operations of <i>A</i> Company.
Go on.”</p>

<p>Major Larry fumbled for an instant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
one of the shining brass buttons of his blue
blouse, then stiffened his back, cleared his
throat, saluted, and began his account of the
battle.</p>

<p>“I have de honor to report,” said he, “dat
de follerin’ t’ings took place, sir, jus’ two
weeks ago yesterd’y, w’ich was Toosd’y.</p>

<p>“First, ’bout de lay o’ de lan’: it lain dis
way. Dere was a big hayin’ field, shaped
somet’in’ like a big piece o’ pie wid a big
bite tooken out’n one end of it&mdash;dat is,
out’n de small end o’ de wedge. De roundin’
edge o’ de field, same’s de part o’ de pie dat
comes nex’ de rim o’ de plate, was composed
of a river. Dis was ’bout two foot deep, an’
it couldn’t be forded across by militia, ’count
o’ de danger o’ wettin’ pants, w’ich is State
propity. So’s dis part o’ de battle-field was
dead-safe. See?”</p>

<p>Rodman desisted for a moment from inscribing
distorted fish-hooks in his note-book,
and glanced towards the colonel. The chief
was vigorously twisting his grey moustache
in a vain attempt to maintain his official
composure.</p>

<p>“Nex’ dat roundin’ edge,” continued Larry
with his eyes fixed upon the golden eagle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
surmounting the regimental color which
occupied one corner of the room, “come a
straight edge. Dat was a road, an’ where it
joined de roundin’ edge was at a bridge ’cross
de river. Den come de point w’ich had be’n
bit off. W’at youse might call de mout’ful was
a sort o’ mixed-up mess o’ bushes an’ trees.</p>

<p>“Dis ’counts for de crust edge, an’ one
side, an’ de bit place o’ de piece o’ pie. De
side dat’s lef’ was made by t’ree little hills,
wid an ol’ stone wall runnin’ up an’ down
along de tops of ’em, like de stripe on a
sergeant’s trowsies. An’ dat was de way in
w’ich de lay o’ de lan’ lain.”</p>

<p>Langforth rose and stepped over to the
corner in which stood the black-board on
whose surface have been worked out so many
problems in regimental strategy. He made
a few rapid passes with the chalk, and there
came into being a map of a range of three
low hills, looking down across a triangular
field towards a highway, and flanked on one
side by a river, on the other by a patch of
scrubby woodland.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de stuff!” commented Larry approvingly,
as this example of topographical
art took form. “’Twas <i>jus’</i> like dat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
“Now,” said the paymaster to the boy,
“you can put in your troops.”</p>

<p>Larry took the crayon in his unwilling
fingers, and doubtfully advanced upon the
black-board. He often had seen officers lay
off the broad white lines denoting the positions
of battalions and companies, but he was
not quite sure that he could perform the feat
himself. However, he was not going to give
up without a trial, and so, bracing himself
for the effort, he slowly and carefully scraped
the chalk across the black surface before him.</p>

<p>“De sec’nd battalion was de enermy,” said
he, after he had chalked the map to his satisfaction.
“Dat is, we was de enermy o’ de
first an’ t’ird battalions. Dey, o’ course, was
<i>our</i> enermy. <i>G</i> was on dis hill, <i>H</i> was on de
middle ’un, an’ <i>L</i> was on de one at de lef’.
<i>A</i> was deplored as skirmishers.”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Deplored</i> as skirmishers!’” said the
colonel softly. “Wonder how Stearns would
like that bit of description.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I mos’ forgot tellin’ ’bout de disposition
o’ de troops,” said Major Larry, suddenly
recalling one of the chief’s requirements.
“Near’s I c’d make out, de disposition o’
most of ’em was fine. Our fellies was disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to knock de stuffin’ out’n de enermy,
an’ if it hadn’t be’n for de cap’n and de lieutenants
we’d have started a private dead-yard
down in our corner w’en <i>K</i>‘s boys come
chargin’ inter de woods.</p>

<p>“An’ dis brings me to de report o’ de
share <i>A</i> took in de purceedin’s. Dis is w’at
<i>A</i> done: de odder t’ree comp’nies was squattin’
down a-top o’ de t’ree little hills, an’ <i>A</i>
was shooken out in a skirmish line, down
’long by de bridge, to make it unhealt’y for
de furriners w’en dey come promenadin’
ahead to cross de river.</p>

<p>“Major Pollard, he comes ridin’ down
from de hills, an he says, ‘Cap’n Stearns,’
says he, ‘w’en you’re drove back from dis
position, youse’ll fall back down de road here,
an’ take y’r command into de cover o’ de
woods on our right flank dere,’ pointin’ at it
wid his sword. ‘Dat’s a strong position,’
says he, ‘an’ de div’l himself couldn’t drive
yer out’n it if dis was really bizness. By
doin’ dis youse’ll purtec’ our flank from bein’
turned, an’ at de same time’ll uncover de
front of us, so’s dat we c’n play fire-works
wid de enermy’s advance. See?’ An’ de
cap’n said he seen, an’ later he done so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Here Larry armed himself with the long,
tapering pointer, and then proceeded with
his narrative. “W’en I come up to reenforce
de comp’ny, de enermy was jus’
marchin’ down to shove us away from de
bridge. It was a dandy sight! De two battalions
looked bigger’n brigades, an’ de colors
was wavin’, an’&mdash;” here Larry was caught
by a sudden inspiration&mdash;“an de colonel was
lookin’ elegant, on a big, white hoss, an’&mdash;”
with a second inspired utterance&mdash;“de
newspaper men was hustlin’ ’roun’ an’ gettin’
on to everyt’ing!”</p>

<p>This bit of spirited description was most
favorably received. The personages mentioned
bowed their acknowledgments, while
Langforth and Woodleigh and the adjutant
applauded generously, and shouted in chorus,
“<i>Hear! Hear!</i>”</p>

<p>“I’d make me oat’,” said Major Larry, thus
encouraged, “dat dis is de bes’ regiment in de
State. W’y, de odder regiments isn’t got no use
at all for us! Dey isn’t in it wid us, an’ anybody
wid bot’ eyes shut c’d tumble to dat. See?”</p>

<p>“You’re not disputed, Major Callahan,”
said the colonel, clasping his hands across his
chest. “Proceed with your report.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
“Well, de enermy kep’ moggin’ along
down to de river,” said the boy obediently,
“an’ w’en dey was gettin’ good an’ handy de
cap’n assembled de comp’ny, an’ sung out,
‘Now youse’ll all set y’r sights at t’ree hunderd,
an’ every popper’s boy of youse must
take aim careful. For de nex’ act on de programme,’
says he, ‘is goin’ to be a volley exercuted
by de full strengt’ of all de artists in
de troupe.’”</p>

<p>“Hold up for a minute, Larry,” broke in
the colonel, when this truly remarkable order
was quoted. “Were those Captain Stearns’
exact words?”</p>

<p>“Well, no-o, sir,” admitted Major Larry.
“P’raps dat aint jus’ w’at he said, but it’s
w’at he was gettin’ at, anyhow. He ’xplained
to ’em dat if ’twas truly fightin’, ’stead o’ bein’
de imitation, he’d keep ’em all under his
t’umb, an’ not let ’em give no exhibition of a
lead shower-bat’, by squirtin’ bullets all over
de lan’scape at deir own sweet conveniences.
In odder words, he give ’em to understan’
dat, w’en it come to firin’ by comp’ny, w’at
he said <i>went</i>!”</p>

<p>“Perfectly proper,” said the colonel, who
is a thorough believer in the virtues of controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
fire. “Perfectly proper. I noticed
that Stearns handled his practice very well
when he was at the bridge.”</p>

<p>“We done t’ree or four volleys,” continued
Larry, “but it was sort o’ discouragin’ bizness,
’cause we didn’t seem to see no corpses
carted off, an’ all we could do didn’t seem
like it was hurtin’ de enermy’s feelin’s much.
So w’en dey kep’ gettin’ closer an’ closer, we
seen dat dey was boun’ to waltz over de
bridge, spite of us, an’ de cap’n come to de conclusion
dat he’d done all dat a brave man could
to stan’ ’em off. W’ich bein’ so, he marched
de comp’ny off an’ fell back down de road,
leavin’ de premises clear for de t’ree comp’nies
on de hills to show w’at dey was good
for.</p>

<p>“Well, we was marched down de road, an’
formed up in line among de trees, where it
was cool an’ shady. An’ den we got de
chance to see sights. De attackin’ battalions
come swarmin’ over dat bridge like a big
mob o’ de unemployed, an’ begun to push
forward for de hills, an’ de rifles started goin’
<i>poppety-poppety-pop</i>! An’ dere we was sittin’
like an audyence in de gallery, takin’
in de whole show for nuttin’. But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
wasn’t quite out of it, for all of a sudd’n de
cap’n says, ‘Here’s w’ere we wipes out dat
fool flank comp’ny!’ An’ wid dat he has us
plug a volley square into ’em.</p>

<p>“Now, dat was like yellin’ ‘<i>Rats!</i>’ in
t’rough de door of a Chinee laundry! O’
course dey wasn’t nobody killed by dat
volley, ’cause de odder fellies was too far off
to be hit by de wads. But de effec’ was
queer, an’ youse c’n bet y’r sweet natyral dat
was de size of it!</p>

<p>“<i>K</i> was de comp’ny dat happened to be
on dat flank, an’ w’en we plunked dat volley
at ’em dey seemed like dey was excited. I
guess dey t’ought we was gettin’ too funny
wid ’m, for dey swung back so’s to be facin’
our way, an’ den begun poppin’ at us for all
dey was wort’.</p>

<p>“But <i>dat</i> never fazed us, ’cause we knew
dat deir rifles didn’t have no slugs in ’em, an’
dat we was pretty well out o’ sight amongst
de trees. An’ besides all dat, we also was
aware dat de fellies in <i>K</i> couldn’t shoot well
enough to hit a mountain if ’twas pushed up
to ’em on rollers. Huh! most o’ de men in
<i>K</i> handles deir rifles like dey was crowbars,
an’ a flock of elerphants flyin’ low c’d sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
over deir heads widout no occasion for
worryin’!” This was taking a mean advantage.
Larry had a personal grievance against
<i>K</i> Company, and sought revenge by improving
the opportunity to slander that command
in his report.</p>

<p>“Now, after t’ings had be’n goin’ on in dis
way for a little w’ile,” continued Larry, “I
seen a chance to tally one for our side.
W’at I mean is dis&mdash;Say, d’youse know
Hickey, dat big, fat-headed corp’ral in <i>K</i>?”</p>

<p>The colonel was compelled to disclaim
the acquaintance of any such person. The
adjutant, however, whose knowledge of the
regimental <i>personnel</i> was necessarily more
extended, came to time promptly with an
affirmative nod.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a dam’ chump!” said Larry,
with emphasis. “Oh, ’xcuse me!” he hastily
added, as it dawned upon him that his
language had been a trifle unparliamentary;
“I didn’t mean to say jus’ dat. But he’s a
reg’lar galvanized gazaboo, an’ nuttin’ else.
See? Him an’ his gang had fun wid me, one
night last camp, tossin’ me in a blanket, an’
I’ve be’n layin’ low for’m ever since dat.
I’m like an Injun&mdash;‘I never forgets de face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of a foe!’” This evidently was a quotation
from some modern master-piece of literature,
and Larry delivered it most impressively.</p>

<p>“But dis aint tellin’ w’at I seen.” Here
the boy picked up the chalk, and made a few
additional marks upon the map of the battle-ground.
“It was like dis,” said he, stepping
back a pace and resting one hand easily upon
his hip, while he gracefully wielded the
pointer with the other; “de fellies in <i>K</i> was
in plain sight, out in de sun, an’ I was here,
’way down at de right o’ de line. See?”
He indicated his own position by means of
the pointer. “Dey was a tree dere, growin’
out’n a crack in a big rock, an’ I was camped
down behin’ de whole bizness, blazin’ away
for glory, an’ makin’ every shot tell, w’en I
seen&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the colonel. “What’s that?
What were <i>you</i> doing with a rifle?”</p>

<p>“Shootin’, sir,” said Larry briefly.</p>

<p>“Yes, so it would appear,” said the colonel.
“But how came you to be armed?”</p>

<p>“W’y, Smit’y de Invalid&mdash;he’s de felly,
y’know, dat’s always tryin’ to sneak off from
doin’ any duty&mdash;he’d tol’ me dat he wasn’t
feelin’ jus’ well, an’ I’d tooken his rifle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
hold for’m w’ile he went off huntin’ for a
drink o’ cold water. He didn’t give me no
ca’tridges, but I’d jollied de boys out’n a
pocketful, an’ had organized meself into a
Mosby gorilla. De cap’n, o’ course, he
didn’t know nuttin’ ‘bout all dis, or he’d a-be’n
wild. Dat’s de reason I was ‘way off
dere to de right&mdash;to keep out’n de cap’n’s
way. See?”</p>

<p>The colonel silently nodded. Apparently
he “saw.” Major Larry, having given this
satisfactory explanation of matters, resumed
the delivery of his interrupted report.</p>

<p>“I tol’ yer dat I seen a promisin’ openin’
for stratergy,” he said; “an’ dis was it: me
bein’ off to de right of <i>A</i> brought me facin’
de lef flank o’ <i>K</i>, an’ <i>who</i> should I discover
opposite o’ me but dat same Hickey! Now,
seein’ Hickey so convenient set me to t’inkin’.</p>

<p>“‘Hickey, me ol’ sporty,’ says I to meself,
‘I’m on y’r trail. Youse once had fun,
heaps o’ fun, a-joshin’ me,’ says I, ‘but dis is
de time I’m comin’ back at you,’ says I.
‘Dat’s de kind of a Reuben dat <i>I</i> am,’
says I. An’ wid dat I fired two blank
ca’tridges at’m, aimin’ careful at his stummick,
so’s to ease me min’. Den I hid me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
rifle in de scrub, so’s de cap’n wouldn’t see
me wid it, an’ slid along back to de nearest
boys on de right of <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>“Big Jonesey was dere, an’ McKenzie, an’
Schultz&mdash;all of ’em aimin’ an’ firin’ like dey
was expectin’ to put medals onto deir dress-coats
t’icker’n de scales on a fish. Dere
wasn’t an officer widin hearin’, bot’ de lieutenants
bein’ off to de centre consultin’ ‘bout
somet’in’ wid de cap’n. W’ich was lucky.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Whis-st, boys!</i>’ says I careful, wavin’
me arm ’round me head to signal ’em to rally
up to me. Dey seen dat I meant somet’in’,
an’ closed up to-wards me. ‘Sa-ay, youse
t’ink you’re doin’ fancy work, a-shootin’ holes
in nuttin’, doesn’t youse?’ says I, w’en dey’d
assembled on me. ‘Well, if youse’ll quit y’r
foolishness an’ foller me,’ I says, ‘youse’ll
wear di’mon’s. Come on lively, ’fore de
lieutenant gets back to miss yer,’ says I.</p>

<p>“Well, dey gives me a look, an’ den dey
looks back t’wards de comp’ny an’ sees dat
de chances is dat dey’ll not be missed for a
little w’ile, an’ den de four of us takes a
quiet sneak off t’rough de shrubb’ry.</p>

<p>“‘Now jus’ listen to me w’ile I gurgle,’
I says, w’en we’d got to de place w’ere me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
rifle was hid. ‘D’youse see dat phernomenum
out dere in de horizon? Well, dat bird
o’ paradise,’ I says, ‘is Hickey, Corp’ral
Hickey, o’ <i>K</i> Comp’ny.’</p>

<p>“‘I want to know if it is!’ says Jonesey.
‘An’ have youse pulled us out here to give
us dat important information! I’m t’inkin’
o’ breakin’ y’r back, Larry,’ says he, ‘an’ I
would, too, if ’twasn’t for losin’ yer de job o’
luggin’ de big drum.’</p>

<p>“‘Is dat <i>so</i>?’ says I, dodgin’ a swipe he
made at me head. ‘S’posin’ youse wait for
me to get t’rough! I’m not talkin’ to fill up
no fonygraft; I’m talkin’ <i>war</i>.’</p>

<p>“‘Leaf’m alone,’ says Schultz, ‘an’ see vat
he hass upon dot gr-reat mindt off his.’ An’
Jonesey, he lef’ me alone.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, dat’s Corp’ral Hickey,’ says I, indicatin’
me objective again wid me rifle. ‘I
know’m easy by de size of his ears. An’ if
youse fellies isn’t all stiffs, we c’n capture
him alive. W’at d’youse say?’ I says.
‘Are youse mugs wid me, or agin me?’</p>

<p>“McKenzie allowed dat ’twould be sport
if we could scoop in Hickey, an’ Schultz was
agreeable to de scheme, so den I ’xplained
w’at I wanted ’em to do, an’ we started in on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
de conspiracy. An’ all dis time, mind youse,
de battle was goin’ on hot an’ heavy. But
we wasn’t mindin’ nobody’s funeral ’ceptin’
ours&mdash;an’ I was de undertaker!</p>

<p>“Dis is w’at I done wid de boys: I posted
’em behin’ bushes an’ trees, right up close to
de edge o’ de woods, but so far from w’ere de
flank of <i>A</i> lain dat nobody ever’d catch on to
deir bein’ dere. An’ den I give me rifle to
McKenzie, an’ strolled out into de field an’
over ’cross t’wards de lef’ o’ <i>K</i>.</p>

<p>“Wen I got widin ’bout fifty yards o’
Mister Hickey, bein’ kind o’ quarterin’n a’
off to one side of’m, I sings out an’ says
‘Does yoore face pa-ain youse, Hickey?’ I
says. ‘I notices dat it kind o’ gets twisted out
o’ shape in aimin’. By de way youse wrinkles
up dat lef eye I should t’ink dat one o’ y’r
lights was went out,’ I says. Dat seemed to
catch de boys in Hickey’s squad, an’ dey
give’m de gran’ laff.</p>

<p>“‘Go chase yerself off’n de field, Larry,’
says Hickey, answerin’ me back. ‘Dis aint
no place for kids. ’Tisn’t safe for youse
’round w’ere I am. I’m feelin’ dryer’n a
covered bridge, an’ ’twouldn’t take much to
make me catch yer an’ drink y’r blood.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“‘<i>Ya-as, yer would!</i>’ says I, t’umbin’ me
nose to’m. ‘Catch nawthin’! Youse
couldn’t catch a cooky at a cake-walk!’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll give yer jus’ t’irty secon’s to clear
out in,’ says Hickey, gettin’ kind o’ looney,
’cause de squad was snickerin’ again, ‘an’ if
y’aint disappeared by dat time, I’ll collar
yer, an’ roll yer up into a small an’ bloody
bundle, an’ stuff yer inter me haversack for
safe keepin’.’</p>

<p>“‘Huh! w’at youse say cuts no ice wid
me!’ says I, scornful. ‘It’s clean nutty dat
youse are. See? Holdin’ down a slab in de
morgue’s all youse c’n do graceful. Sure!’</p>

<p>“Dat was jus’ a little bit more’n Hickey
was prepared to stan’. ‘Here, hang on to
me rifle,’ says he, handin’ it over to de neares’
man o’ de squad, ‘an’ watch me capture de
firs’ prisoner o’ de campaign.’ An’ wid dat
he gives a proud leer, an’ makes a break
for me.</p>

<p>“‘Some o’ youse hol’ de watch on us,’ I
sings out. ‘Dis is for de amachoor sprintin’
rekid!’ An’ off I starts for de brush, towin’
me victim along behin’ me.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’twas hot stuff! At firs’ I was ’fraid
dat some of his officers would catch onto’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
an’ call’m back; but de smoke was driftin’
off our way, an’ we was travellin’ away from
de flank o’ de battalion, an’ so nobody paid
no ’tention to us ’cept a few o’ de boys down
at dat end.</p>

<p>“Well, I kep’ humpin’ for all I was wort’, an’
Hickey, he was after me for all <i>he</i> was wort’,
an’ fin’lly we strikes cover at ’bout de same
time. I makes a flyin’ dive inter de bushes,
like a rabbit wid de shakin’ jim-jams, an’
Hickey shoots’mself in after me&mdash;an’ lands
up against de muzzle o’ Jonesey’s rifle!”</p>

<p>“‘Halt!’ sings out Jonesey, ‘an’ surrender,
you red-handed cut-t’roat!’ An’ Hickey halts&mdash;prompt,
too. But ‘stead o’ surrenderin’,
he turned an’ started to take a travel back for
de open. An’ jus’ den Schultz, he rose up
out’n de eart’ on de one side of’m, an’ McKenzie,
he surrounded ’m on de odder side, an’
den poor Hickey seen dat his goose was
cooked.</p>

<p>“‘T’row’m down, boys,’ I says. An’ dey
t’run’m down, an’ de place w’ere dey happened
to t’run’m was boggy, so’s dat w’en
he rose up he looked like he hadn’t shooken
hands wid a piece o’ soap for more’n a mont’.</p>

<p>“‘Boys, it’s me sorrerful dooty,’ I says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
‘to tell yer dat Hickey’s drinkin’ again.’
An’ den I tol’m w’at he’d said ’bout capturin’
me an’ drinkin’ me blood. An’ dey was
astonished an’ shocked.</p>

<p>“‘Is dis civerlized war?’ says McKenzie,
glarin’ at de pris’ner. ‘You’re worse dan a
Dahomey cannib’l&mdash;scarin’ de life out’n dis
innercent child! Shall we give ’m quarter?’
he says, turnin’ to de odder fellies.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got a few t’ousand in me clodes,’
I says, like I was considerin’, ‘but I aint got
no quarter for <i>him</i>. Away wid ’m!’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Dammit!’ says Hickey, growin’ excited,
‘can’t youse quit y’r foolin’? I mus’ be
gettin’ back to de comp’ny or I’ll be losin’
me stripes!’</p>

<p>“‘Hear de hardened vilyun cursin’ w’en
deat’ stares’m in de eye!’ says McKenzie,
holdin’ up his hands wid horror. ‘Oh, Hickey,
Hickey, you’re in danger o’ losin’ de number o’
y’r mess&mdash;den w’y worry ’bout a little t’ing
like a pair o’ miser’ble corp’ral’s stripes?’</p>

<p>“‘Boys,’ I says, ‘I pity dis poor mug.
S’posin’ we fin’ out how he’s feelin’ ’bout dis
time?’ An’ I turned t’wards de pris’ner.
‘Hickey,’ I says, ‘are youse ever goin’ to
preside over anodder blanket-tossin’ convention&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
mean, one wid <i>me</i> in it?’ An’ he
swore dat he hones’ wouldn’t.</p>

<p>“‘Higky,’ asks Schultz, ‘vill you dot
pecos off dis affair dere shall no hart veelin’
pe?’ An’ Hickey said dat dere shouldn’t.</p>

<p>“‘Hickey,’ says McKenzie, w’en it come
his turn at de bat, ‘if you’re lucky ’nough
to come out alive at de end o’ dis awful day
o’ strife will youse remember dat odder
people ’sides y’rself has t’roats&mdash;w’ich
needs occasional wettin’?’ An’ Hickey give
his word dat he’d set ’em up for de crowd
w’en we got back to town.</p>

<p>“‘Dis all bein’ so,’ says Jonesey, ‘an’ no
objection bein’ made, we’ll spare y’r wort’less
life. But we’re under oat’ to do our full
duty by de Commonwealt’ for a term o’
t’ree years, an’ so we can’t let yer go. Private
McKenzie on de right, Private Schultz
on de lef’, de pris’ner betwixt youse&mdash;<i>fall
in</i>!’ says he. An’ dey fell in, an’ started
back t’wards de comp’ny, wid Hickey a-kickin’
himself for a t’underin’ jackuss, an’
me a-follerin’, t’umpin’ meself wid joy.</p>

<p>“Well, we comes back to de comp’ny, an’
I makes a break for de head o’ de percession&mdash;’cause
’twas <i>my</i> entertainment, y’ know&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>an’
w’en de fellies sees us marchin’ up, dey sets
up a yell, for dey all knows Hickey. An’ w’en
we gets to de cap’n I salutes an’ says, ‘Cap’n,
here’s a spy,’ I says. ‘W’at’ll we do wid’m?’</p>

<p>“Cap’n Stearns, he looked Hickey all over,
an’ seen de dirt on’m, an’ says, ‘Whew! he
looks like he’d be’n huntin’ for trouble an’
foun’ it! Are dey diggin’ a mine under us,
or w’at? Take’m away,’ he says, ‘an’ play
de hose on’m an’ don’t bodder me wid’m.’
An’ he had to laff.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t get no time for a real <i>good</i>
laff, ’cause jus’ den de enermy begun to
charge us, an’ he had his han’s full keepin’
de boys from fightin’ in earnest. For our
fellies wasn’t goin’ to let <i>K</i> walk on deir
necks. But ’twas ’gainst orders for bayonets
to be crossed, an’ so we played dat we was
captured. But we wasn’t, all de same, for
if’t had b’en really <i>war</i> we’d have kep’ a
coroner’s jury busy for a week sortin’ out de
remains o’ <i>K</i>.</p>

<p>“An’ dat, sir,” said Major Larry, facing
towards the colonel with a final salute,
“near’s I c’n remember, is w’at <i>A</i> done, two
weeks ago yesterd’y, at de right o’ Major
Pollard’s line o’ battle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The colonel brought out a half-dollar.
“Larry,” said he, handing it to the boy, “we
all are greatly indebted to you for your excellent
and most technical report. For my
own part, I can truthfully say that I’ve
learned a great deal about grand strategy.
You are excused, with the thanks of all
present.”</p>

<p>Larry left the room with the step of a
grenadier. Rodman closed his note-book
with a snap, saying softly, “That’ll be good
for two columns.” There was an instant of
awed silence. And then the colonel turned to
the adjutant, and said, “Hereafter, Charley,
there’ll be two reports made of anything that
<i>A</i> may be concerned in&mdash;one written, and
one oral. That’s a standing order. <i>See?</i>”</p>

<p>Rodman’s notes worked up to two columns
and a half of the next day’s <i>Globe</i>, and for a
second time Major Larry Callahan found
himself locally famous. What Captain Tom
Stearns said when his eye fell upon the
marked copy of the paper which was thoughtfully
mailed to him by the adjutant, is not
upon record. But it is a fact that he has
been more than prompt, of late, in the matter
of forwarding required reports.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>SPECIAL ORDERS, NO. 49.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">They</span> call it the incurable ward. In
coming down the corridor one sees
above its doorway, upon the blank,
white wall, a plain, black letter <i>A</i>. It almost
seems as though the painter had thought to
transcribe there, “All hope abandon”&mdash;and
then had relented, after outlining the initial
letter of the grisly legend. Perhaps he well
might have finished his work, for those who
enter that quiet room are borne thither because
their days are nearly numbered.</p>

<p>On that afternoon there was but one patient
in Ward <i>A</i>. He seemed content to lie motionless,
watching with drowsy, half-closed
eyes the play of a stray shaft of sunlight
upon the snowy counterpane. Beside him,
steadily swinging a fan, sat a white-robed
nurse. The long June day was wearing
slowly on towards its ending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
In through the casement to the westward
there came a soft breath of flower-scented air.
The nurse felt its caress upon her cheek, and
laid aside her fan. Then, with a little sigh
of relief, she rose from her chair, and quietly
stole over to the window for a moment’s
glance out into the garden which lay below.</p>

<p>She was standing there when her trained
ear caught the sound of a restless movement
upon the cot. “A glass of water, please,”
murmured the sick man, as she turned and
came quickly towards him.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said he, after a long, grateful
draught from the glass which she had
held to his lips. “I must be a terrible nuisance
to you. But,” he added, in a lower
tone, “it’ll not be for much longer, please
God!”</p>

<p>“<i>Sh-h!</i>” said the nurse, reprovingly. “You
mustn’t say that. I can’t see, I’m sure, why
it should be thought that nurses are intended
more for ornament than use. Not,” with a
smile, “but that we’re flattered by that view
of the situation.”</p>

<p>“But really and truly,” she went on, picking
up the fan, “we should grow terribly
tired of the monotony if it weren’t for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
relief that comes from doing these little
things.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must believe you,” said the
sick man, smiling faintly in his turn. “And
if&mdash;‘really and truly’&mdash;it will serve to
break the monotony, I’ll venture to ask you
to do me one more favor. About that packet
of trinkets that I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, how stupid of me!” exclaimed the
nurse, hastily rising from her chair. “The
superintendent sent them in while you were
taking your nap.” With the swift, noiseless
step of one long trained in hospital service
she crossed the room, and took from the
mantel a small package. “Here they are,”
said she. “Shall I take them out for you?”</p>

<p>At his nod of assent she deftly untied the
faded blue ribbon with which the packet was
secured, removed the tissue-paper covering,
and brought to light a jewel-case, in which
lay three military decorations&mdash;the badge of
the Loyal Legion, the plain, bronze star of
the Grand Army, and the enamelled Maltese
cross of the old 19th Army Corps.</p>

<p>One by one she laid the medals upon the
thin hand feebly outstretched over the white
coverlid, and for a moment the sick man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
tired eyes kindled as he gazed upon them.
But the feeble hand relaxed, the eyes quickly
became dim again. “Ah, well,” he said, a
bit huskily, “I’m through&mdash;through with
all that now. And I’ve no son&mdash;there’s no
one to care&mdash;no one to whom I can leave these
things. You’ll see that some one pins them
on my breast when&mdash;when I’m carried out?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the nurse, gathering up the
medals as she spoke, “I’ll be very careful
about having it done.” And then she added
quietly, “I’ll attend to it myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m wofully helpless,” said the man upon
the cot apologetically; “may I trouble you to
hand me the photograph?”</p>

<p>The nurse drew from beneath his pillow a
faded and worn morocco case, opened it, and
handed it to him. Then she turned away
and made pretence of busying herself about
some little matter, while her charge looked
long and wistfully upon the picture of a
woman’s face that smiled back at him from
its resting place within the leathern frame.</p>

<p>The sick man sighed, but not unhappily.
A look of peace came upon his worn face, and
a smile&mdash;a wonderfully tender smile&mdash;hovered
about his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
“Will you put the medals under my pillow?”
said he, as the nurse came towards the
bed. “Thank you. Really, you’ve been
very kind to me. I’d like to tell you how
grateful I am for it all&mdash;but may be I
needn’t. My mind’s quite at rest now: those
letters that you wrote for me settled the last
of my worries. And now I’m not sure&mdash;I
think&mdash;think that perhaps I could sleep
again for a little while.” He wearily turned
his head to one side, resting it upon the palm
of his hand. And within the hand, pressed
close against his cheek, lay the photograph in
its worn and faded case.</p>

<p>The nurse smoothed out the pillow, passed
her hand gently over the iron-grey hair that
clustered thickly above his forehead, and
taking her place by the bedside, once more
began to swing the fan slowly to and fro.</p>

<p>In the great, white room the shadows
deepened as the sun went down. The sick
man was breathing regularly, but very lightly.
He had fallen asleep. Once the silent
watcher saw his lips move, and caught the
sound of murmured words: then all was still
again. The fan swung slowly back and forth&mdash;still
more slowly&mdash;and then it stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The world outside seemed very beautiful
in the June twilight, and the confinement, by
contrast, became doubly irksome. The nurse
slipped quietly over to the open window.
She was standing there when the house surgeon
came briskly into the room. “S-sh!”
said she, turning at the sound of the footsteps,
and raising a warning hand. “He’s
asleep.”</p>

<p>But the surgeon already was standing beside
the cot. He gave one keen glance at
the form lying before him, and placed his
hand over the heart. Then he straightened
up and turned towards the nurse. His face
had become grave. “Yes,” said he, in answer
to the look of anxious inquiry; “yes, he’s
asleep. I hadn’t looked for this before tomorrow,”
he went on quietly, “but he’s&mdash;he’s
asleep, as you say.”</p>

<p>Dimness had come with the failing light,
but it was not so dark that the doctor and the
nurse could not see upon the dead man’s face
the calm smile of perfect peace. “See,”
whispered the nurse, gently drawing the
photograph from its resting place&mdash;and as
she held the picture towards her companion
she gave a little sob. “Yes, I see,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
surgeon, softly. “I know his story.” And
then in a lower tone he added, “He’s asleep
at last. <i>God send him rest!</i>”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was nearing nine o’clock. Colonel
Elliott glanced at his watch, and then leaned
back in his chair with the comfortable consciousness
that his evening’s work was over.
One by one he had gone through the pile of
papers that he had found upon his desk. He
had written, “Respectfully forwarded, approved,”
upon each in its turn, and now they
were ready to go to the adjutant, to be entered
up and sent along upon their sluggish
travels “through channels.”</p>

<p>The colonel gathered the scattered documents
into a bunch, snapped a rubber band
about them, and then called, “Orderly!”</p>

<p>“Take these papers to the adjutant,” said
the chief, as a soldier stepped promptly into
the room, with his hand at his cap. “Then
find Major Pollard, and say to him, with my
compliments, that I’d like him to report to
me here.”</p>

<p>The orderly saluted, and disappeared. The
colonel bit the tip from a cigar, lighted it,
and then drew from his pocket a half dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
letters. Rapidly running through them, he
picked out one, tossed it upon his desk, and
then, letting his head fall back, he fixed his
eyes upon the ceiling, and smoked away in
thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>Along the broad corridors of the armory
echoed the steady tramp of feet, the rattle of
arms, and the sharp commands of the line
officers, for it was a regular drill-night of The
Third, and four of the regiment’s twelve companies
were at work in the great hall lying
beyond the administrative rooms. Presently,
above the hum of the other sounds, the colonel
heard quick, firm footsteps approaching his
door, and in a moment Major Pollard and
Van Sickles, of the staff, came into the room.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, Colonel?” said the
major, inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the chief, adding, as Van
Sickles made a motion as if to withdraw, “I’d
like to have you stay, Van. I’ve something
to tell that’ll answer a question you once
asked me.”</p>

<p>Both drew up chairs. The colonel passed
over his cigar case, and then said, “A year
ago you fellows got me to talking, one night
up in The Battery, about something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
happened while I was out with the ‘Old Regiment.’
As I recall it, I told you a yarn about
the resurrection of Bob Sheldon, and you,
Van, asked me, when I’d finished, what had
become of Bob since the war. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Sheldon?” said Van Sickles. “Oh, yes.
He was the man that was brained by a splinter
of shell, and afterwards came to time all
right. Your old captain, wasn’t he? Yes, I
remember.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the colonel slowly, “I had a
letter from him this morning&mdash;and he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Not really!” said Van Sickles, as the
chief made this odd announcement. “Well,
I’m sorry on your account, sir.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead, poor old Bob!” said the
colonel, resting his elbow upon the edge of his
desk and letting his chin drop into the palm
of his hand. “Yes, he’s got his papers at
last. And now, Van, I can take up the story
that I left unfinished. It was incomplete then,
but now the last chapter’s been written.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had the first of it already,” went
on the chief, settling back in his chair.
“Here’s the rest of it&mdash;and the last of it.
You’ll listen, too, Pollard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
“I’ve told you already, I think, that Bob
Sheldon and I were the closest of friends. I
stood up with him when he was married to
his Nell&mdash;his ‘little Nell’&mdash;the girl whose
name came to his lips when he lay in delirium
after the shell had struck him down. Poor
little Nell&mdash;poor old Bob! Well, all the
trouble’s ended at last.</p>

<p>“The friendships that are made in active
service are lasting ones. When the ‘Old
Regiment’ came back, after doing its share of
the work of hammering our erring brothers
into a peaceful state, Bob was on the roster as
major, and I’d been given his old company.
But it never occurred to either of us, when
off duty, that such a thing as rank had any
existence. It was ‘Bob’ for him and ‘Harry’
for me, and he’d have thought me crazy if I’d
addressed him as ‘Major’ except when I was
at the head of my company.</p>

<p>“I’ll be older than I am now before I forget
the day that we were mustered out. We’d
gone to the front with something over the
full thousand: there were three hundred and
sixty of us, rank and file, when we came home
again. For we’d been a fighting regiment
from start to finish, and the hard knocks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
four long years had cut the original roll to
ribbons. Those were the days when veteran
regiments were allowed to dwindle down to
skeletons, through battle and disease, while
the recruits that should have been turned
over to them to stop the gaps were herded together
in one raw, half useless lump, given a
fresh regimental number and a stand of colors
bright and crisp from the shop, and then
bundled off to where there was <i>fighting</i> to be
done&mdash;and all because some ambitious politician
felt that a pair of eagles would be becoming
to his peculiar style of corpulent
beauty.</p>

<p>“We had a royal welcome home. I needn’t
tell you what battles were gilded on the
stripes of the old flag, because you know well
enough the sort of record that we fellows
made when cutting out the pace for you
youngsters. We’d done our work, and we
knew that we’d done it well, and we felt that
the people knew it, too. And when we made
our last march, that day, through the swarming
streets, we took as rightfully ours the
cheers that went up as the wreck of the ‘Old
Regiment’ followed the faded colors home
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
“Then came the final breaking up; the
time when ‘break ranks’ meant that regimental
line never would be formed again. I
remember how, for the last time, we presented
to the colors&mdash;the ragged, blood-streaked
scraps of silk whose worn folds told our
whole war story. Bob turned to me when
the tattered old things were being carried
away from us forever. His face was working,
and&mdash;I doubt, though, if he knew it&mdash;a
big tear was rolling down each gaunt, sun-burned
cheek. I&mdash;well, I was sobbing like
a child, I’m not ashamed to say. So were
the boys at my back&mdash;God bless ’em!</p>

<p>“‘Bob,’ says I, trying to swallow the lump
in my throat, ‘Bob, old man, what’s left for
us now?’ He turned in his saddle and
looked across the parade to where a group of
white gowns&mdash;his Nell was there, with the
colonel’s wife and a lot of other women&mdash;had
gathered to watch the last act in our
war drama. ‘What’s left?’ says he, turning to
me again, ‘What’s left? Why, <i>everything</i>!’
And though the tears still glistened at the
corners of his eyes, his face shone with the
light that has but one meaning.</p>

<p>“Well, we of the ‘Old Regiment’ shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
hands, and drifted back to our places in civil
life. There are easier things than dropping
the customs of the service, and taking up the
monotony of everyday existence. It came
hard at first, but we managed it somehow.</p>

<p>“Bob was married. He wouldn’t let a
week go by, after we were mustered out, before
he had that much of his career settled. I
volunteered to stand by him to the last, and
he held me in reserve as best man until the
knot was safely tied. It was a military wedding.
Nearly all the officers of the ‘Old
Regiment’ were there. It was a dingy looking
lot of uniforms that gathered in the little
church, but the men inside the faded blue
coats were all right.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t long before I followed Bob’s example.
Then life ran on smoothly with us
both for a long stretch of years. To be sure,
we missed the excitement of the old days;
but I’d come ’round to Bob’s view of life, and
was willing to admit that there was a good
deal left to live for, after all. There are several
queer things about war: one of ’em is the way
in which it teaches old soldiers to appreciate
the comfort of peace.</p>

<p>“Yes, life ran on smoothly for a time,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
repeated the colonel with a sigh; “and then
came trouble, big trouble for poor Bob. He
had one child, a boy. He was a bright, sturdy
chap. Bob really believed that the world revolved
’round him. But just after he’d had
his tenth birthday, he died.</p>

<p>“It was terribly rough! Bob had planned
to send the youngster to ‘The Point,’ when
the proper time came; and he’d talk to me
by the hour of the pride he’d feel when he
had a son in the service. ‘Harry,’ he’d say,
when we’d be smoking our old pipes together,
‘you and I were good enough soldiers according
to our lights: we could fight just as
nastily as though we’d been in the business
for a lifetime. But when it came to the fine
points of the profession, we weren’t quite up
to concert pitch; the fellows from ‘The
Point’ scored on us then. Now, there’s
going to be another war some day. It’s a
long way ahead, and it’s two to tuppence
that we’ll not be in it. But I want to feel
that the name of Sheldon will be on some
regiment’s roster then&mdash;and I’m thinking
that little Bob’ll take care of that for me.’</p>

<p>“It was cruel work for poor Bob when we
laid the little fellow away, and my heart went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
out to him in his trouble. But there was a
heavier blow yet to fall. Two years after
we’d buried the boy, I stood by Bob’s side
and gripped his arm while his wife’s coffin
was being lowered into the grave. My God!
I learned then what despair meant. When
all was over, Bob clung to me, and asked the
question that I’d put to him on the day they
took our old colors from us. ‘Harry,’ he
said, almost with a groan, ‘Harry, what’s left
for me now?’ And before I could think of
the words that I wanted, he answered his
own question with, ‘<i>Nothing!</i>’</p>

<p>“And then I lost him for a time. He
simply dropped everything and went away.
For three years he was abroad, and from time
to time I’d hear from him. But the letters
were hopelessly unhappy, and I knew that
he’d not recovered from the wrench that he’d
got. Then came four months of silence.</p>

<p>“I was beginning to get alarmed at not
hearing from him, when, one fearfully hot
day in August, I looked up from my work,
and saw him standing by the desk in my
office. ’Pon my soul, I couldn’t have been
blamed for thinking that I saw his ghost!
He was haggard and thin, and his eyes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
a troubled, haunted look that made my heart
ache for him.</p>

<p>“‘I’m back again,’ he said, holding out his
hand. ‘It’s hot, isn’t it? I’m going to ask
you a favor, Harry. The old house over in
Cambridge has been closed ever since&mdash;ever
since I went away, and I’m going there this
afternoon: will you go with me?’</p>

<p>“I hadn’t lunched, but he seemed feverishly
impatient to be off, and fairly dragged me
along with him. We took a cab, and started
on the long, hot ride. I did all the talking
on the way: he sat silently by me, and his
face wore a look that made me terribly uneasy.</p>

<p>“When we were nearly at the end of our
ride I happened to catch sight of a doctor’s
sign upon the door of a house, and to my
surprise I saw that it bore the name of the
assistant surgeon of the ‘Old Regiment.’ A
sudden idea came to me, and I made the cabman
pull up, explaining to Bob that I’d a
message to leave for a friend. I was pretty
sure that he’d not notice anything: the look
in his eyes told me that his mind was busy
with something besides his surroundings.</p>

<p>“Running up to the door, I pulled the bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in a way that meant business, and in a very
short time I’d explained matters to the doctor.
We agreed between us that the heat
and the strain of coming back to the desolate
home might work upon Bob in a fashion that,
coupled with the effect of his old wound,
would bring on bad results. So we arranged
that the doctor should follow, in about a
quarter of an hour, and drop in at Bob’s
house as if by accident. It was a clumsy
sort of scheme, I must confess, but it was the
best that I could think of under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Bob and I drove on. When we reached
the house, he tried to unlock the door, but
his hand shook so pitifully that I took the
key from him, and let him in. The house
was hot and close, and the air musty with
the damp of long disuse. It <i>was</i> a mournful
home-coming, and I felt that it couldn’t help
doing harm of some sort to poor Bob.</p>

<p>“We went about from room to room. I
opened a window here and there, for though
the outside air was torrid anything seemed
preferable to the closeness of those long untenanted
walls. Bob moved in a dazed sort
of way, as if he were walking in a dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
I’d tried to find out if he had any definite
object in coming, but he answered me incoherently,
and I gave up my questioning.</p>

<p>“We’d been there for a full quarter of an
hour when the door-bell rang. It sounded
queerly, that tinkling peal in the silence of
the deserted house. Bob jumped as if he’d
been struck, when he heard the bell. ‘What’s
that?’ he said nervously.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll go to the door,’ says I, knowing well
enough what it meant. ‘Thank you,’ said
Bob; ‘if it isn’t too much bother. I don’t
care about seeing any of the neighbors just
yet. I’ll run upstairs for a second, and you
can call me when the coast’s clear.’</p>

<p>“I opened the door, and there stood the
doctor. ‘Hello, Elliott!’ he sang out, in a
purposely loud voice, ‘<i>You</i> here? I happened
to be passing, and noticed that the
windows were open. Has the major come
back?’ He stepped into the hall, and I
closed the door behind him. ‘Yes, he turned
up to-day,’ said I, also very loudly and
distinctly. ‘He’ll be glad to see you.
Funny coincidence, your dropping in on us
this way. Sort of regimental reunion, eh?
We’ll have to&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
“I stopped right there. A pistol shot rang
out in one of the upper chambers, and after
it came the sound of a heavy fall. ‘God!
we’re too late,’ gasped the doctor. But he
rushed for the stairs without an instant’s hesitation,
and I tore up after him.</p>

<p>“Poor old Bob was lying on his face, in
the room that had been his wife’s. His old
army revolver lay smoking beside him, where
it had fallen when he dropped. The blood
was streaming from his head, and the first
horrified glance showed me that the track of
the bullet almost exactly followed the scar
left by the splinter of shell that had bowled
him over years before.</p>

<p>“The doctor went down upon his knees.
Rapidly examining the bleeding wound, he
looked up at me and said grimly, ‘This is bad
business, Captain, bad business. But he’s
failed in his undertaking. Nerves must have
gone back on him. That was a glancing
shot: it didn’t penetrate.’ He rapidly ran
his eye around the room. ‘See where it
went?’ he said, pointing to a ragged break in
the plastering.</p>

<p>“We lifted Bob from the floor and laid
him on the bed. The doctor went to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and stopped the bleeding, talking softly to me
all the while. ‘I don’t like it at all,’ he said.
‘He’ll not die from this, but I’m in doubt
about the effect it’ll have on his brain. It’s
a nasty shock for a man in his over-wrought
condition. Queer, isn’t it, that I should be
patching up the same place that I worked
over so long ago? He’s in for brain fever,
poor devil! It’s a hard thing to say, Elliott,
but I’m not sure that he wouldn’t have been
luckier if his lead had gone straight in.’</p>

<p>“Well, the rest of the story can be told in
few words. Bob didn’t die. The doctors
pulled him safely through, and saved a life
that might better have been allowed to slip
away. For when the fever that followed
upon the shock of the wound had burned itself
out, the delirium remained, and all that
was left of as fine a man as ever served was a
hopelessly insane wreck.</p>

<p>“It’s twelve years since I’ve seen him.
They wouldn’t let me come to visit him at
the asylum, fearing that the sight of me might
affect him unfavorably. Poor Bob! he’s been
out of the world for all that time&mdash;waiting
to wear out! From time to time I’ve had
reports from the doctors, but never a cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
one until to-day, when I received a letter
from Bob himself&mdash;and by the same mail got
word that death had come at last to bring
him his release.</p>

<p>“It seems that the end came very suddenly.
There was a physical collapse, as if his vital
machinery had run down all at once. But at
the very last the cloud lifted from his mind,
and before he died he had become, mentally,
almost his old self. It was on his last afternoon
that he dictated this letter to me.” The
colonel leaned forward and took the envelope
from his desk. “I’m going to read you a
paragraph or two from it, because it concerns
you, in a way.”</p>

<p>The colonel glanced at his two listeners.
Van Sickles was smoking calmly, as is his
wont. Pollard’s cigar had gone out, and he
was bending forward in his chair, with his
eyes expectantly fixed upon the chief. It was
evident that he was not a little moved by
what he had heard.</p>

<p>“Here’s what he says,” said the colonel,
rapidly glancing through the contents of one
sheet, and beginning to read from the second:
“‘They tell me, Harry, that you’ve found it
impossible to stay out of the service, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
these peaceful times, and that you’ve a command
of your own&mdash;that it’s fallen to you to
be at the head of the regiment that’s keeping
our old name and number alive. If that’s
true, I’ve a favor to ask from you. Don’t
think it the whim of a madman, for it’s not.
To come to it at once, I want a major’s escort
when they put me away. It’s my soberly
sane desire, and the last one that I shall have
in this world. You’ll see that I’m not disappointed?
I knew you would, and I’ll thank
you in advance. Perhaps you’d do well to
let the boys of the ‘Old Regiment’ know
when and where the funeral will be: some of
them might like to be there. But I’ll leave
it all to you.’”</p>

<p>The colonel paused. His voice had become
just the least bit unsteady. To cover
his feelings he struck a match, but forgot to
apply it to his cigar until it had burned down
so far that he had to drop it hastily upon the
floor.</p>

<p>“Is that all, sir?” asked Pollard, when the
colonel stopped reading.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might give you the last paragraph,”
replied the chief huskily, again turning
to the sheet that he held. “‘Good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Harry,’ it runs. ‘I’m tiring fast, and the
nurse says I must stop and rest. You’ll remember
about the escort? I’ve no family
left, and few friends, so I must look to you
for everything. We’ll meet again sometime,
I’ve a firm conviction. Things will be happier
then, and brighter. So good-bye once
more, old fellow, and God bless&mdash;.’” The
colonel choked, and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Major Pollard pulled himself up from his
chair. “Will you order out my battalion as
escort, sir?” he asked earnestly. “I should
consider it a great honor, and I’m sure that
the men would look at it in the same
way.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll find something for me to
do,” began Van Sickles, coming towards the
colonel’s desk. “I’d be glad to help in any
way; about flowers, or music, or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank you both,” said the chief, giving a
hand to each. “I knew you’d help me out
in this. Yes, I’ll order you out, Pollard.
I’ll have the adjutant issue a special order at
once. Perhaps you’d do well to speak to
your company commanders about it now, before
they dismiss. We’ll have the funeral on
Sunday afternoon. I shall call on you, Van,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
for help in a number of little matters between
now and then.”</p>

<p>Pollard left the room, going to pass word
to his captains. The colonel and Van Sickles
went to the staff-room, where the adjutant
and sergeant major were wrestling with the
never-ending “paper work” of regimental
headquarters.</p>

<p>“Charley,” said the chief, as he came to
the adjutant’s desk, “what was the number
of the last regimental special order?”</p>

<p>“I think it was 48, sir,” said the adjutant,
dragging the order-book from its resting
place, and rapidly running over its pages.
“Yes, 48 it was.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll trouble you to make me out
49,” said the colonel. “Have it run something
like this: ‘The 3rd Battalion will
report to Major Pollard, on Sunday next, for
the performance of escort duty at the funeral
of Robert Hunnewell Sheldon, late major of
this regiment when in the service of the
United States, 1861&ndash;65.’”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was a bright, warm Sunday. Against
the cloudless sky the grim battlements of the
armory towered up in bold relief. Upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
tiny flanking turret which caps one corner of
the massive watch-tower, the half-masted
flag hung down in drooping folds of white
and red, unstirred by any passing breeze.</p>

<p>The streets were almost deserted. But
within the great armory there was unwonted
life and movement: and when the clocks of
the city were striking the hour of three, the
ponderous, iron-bound doors swung heavily
apart, and, company by company, Major Pollard’s
battalion of The Third came marching
out, under the frowning archway and down
the wide granite steps.</p>

<p>The major formed his command in line,
facing the entrance. A moment later he
brought the battalion to a “present,” faced
about, and saluted, as six sergeants of the
regiment came slowly down the steps, bearing
out into the June sunlight a plain, black
casket, which they placed in the waiting
hearse.</p>

<p>Then came a handful of men in citizen’s
dress, the survivors of the ‘Old Regiment’&mdash;grey-haired
men, most of them, but all
wearing proudly the bronze star, and the
Maltese cross of their long-disbanded army
corps. These were followed by the colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and nearly all the officers of the active regiment,
in full dress; for the story had spread
through The Third, and&mdash;though the chief
had expressed no formal wish&mdash;it somehow
had become understood that he would be glad
to have this mark of respect shown for the
dead officer who had been his friend and
comrade.</p>

<p>The escorting battalion moved to its position,
the muffled drums of the field music
began to beat, and the column, leaving the
deserted armory to its Sunday quiet, slowly
took up the march towards the elm-shadowed
churchyard where, beside two low, green
mounds, an open grave lay waiting.</p>

<p>The chaplain, book in hand, took his place
beside the heap of freshly turned mould,
ready to begin the recital of the solemn service
for the dead. “Forasmuch as it hath
pleased Almighty God to take unto Himself
the soul of our brother here departed,” he
read, slowly and distinctly, as the coffin was
lowered gently to its resting place; “we
therefore commit his body to the ground;
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.”</p>

<p>The service ended, and the chaplain softly
closed his book. Then came the commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
for the firing, given in a tone strangely unlike
that to which the men were accustomed.
Three echoing volleys followed, telling those
who chanced to hear that another soldier of
the half-forgotten war had been laid at rest.</p>

<p>The blue-white smoke from the rifles, silvered
here and there by shafts of sunlight,
drifted lazily up through the branches of the
overhanging elms: there was an interval of
silence, finally broken by the mellow notes
of a bugle thrilling out the bars of <i>Taps</i>, the
soldier’s requiem; and then the escort broke
into column and marched away, leaving the
little knot of older men still standing in the
shady churchyard.</p>
